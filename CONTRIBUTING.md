## Preview rendering

You can preview the rendered result of the docs in by calling the following URL:
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/tree/<your branch>

For example

* https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/tree/main renders the branch main
* https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/tree/lwolf-mychange renders branch lwolf-mychange
* https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/linawolf/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/tree/lwolf-mychange renders the branch lwolf-mychange in my personal fork

Hint: Use the VSStudio in browser as preview, PHPStorm is very slow
