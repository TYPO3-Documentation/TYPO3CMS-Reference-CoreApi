Debug Exception Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functions of :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Error\DebugExceptionHandler`:

- Shows detailed exception messages and full trace of an exception.

- Logs exception messages to :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::syslog()` which is able to write
  exception messages to a file, to the web server's error\_log, the
  system's log and it can send you errors and exceptions in an email.
  :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::syslog()` offers a hook an can be extended by user-defined
  logging methods.

- Logs exception messages to :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::devLog()` if
  `$TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][enable_errorDLOG]` is enabled (depending on the devlog extension
  used, this might require an existing DB connection).

- Logs exception messages to the sys\_log table. Logged errors are
  displayed in the belog extension (Admin Tools > Log) (works only if there is
  an existing DB connection).
