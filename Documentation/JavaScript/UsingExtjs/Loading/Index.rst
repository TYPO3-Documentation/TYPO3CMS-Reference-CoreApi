Loading ExtJS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To load the ExtJS library use this syntax::

   $this->doc->loadExtJS();

There are 2 optional parameters in this call::

   $this->doc->loadExtJS($css = TRUE, $theme = TRUE);

- The first parameter is a boolean. If set to true, :file:`ext-all.css` is
  added automatically.

- The second parameter is also a boolean. If set to true, theme-grey is
  added automatically.

Additionally the function takes care of:

- adding the correct adapter

- adding the localization file of BE-User language

- adding :code:`Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL`

To do debugging in the ExtJS library, use the following call to force
the debug variant to be loaded::

   $this->doc->setExtJSdebug();
