===================
Terms and spellings
===================

This chapter is about how to use terms in this manual and how to spell them
correctly.

1. Consult the :doc:`genindex` page first. All terms their have been carefully
   chosen.

2. This chapter serves as supplement to the index page and does not try to be
   complete by its own.

2. Do NOT consult the current sitemap as the spelling of titles is in a
   transition phase.
