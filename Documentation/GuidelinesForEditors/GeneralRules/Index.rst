General rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "General Guidelines" also apply to editors – especially the
section "Secure passwords" and "Operating system and browser version",
see above.

Due to the fact that editors do not change the configuration of the
system, there are only a few things editors should be aware of. As a
general rule, you should contact the person or team who/which is
responsible for the system (usually the provider of the TYPO3
instance, a TYPO3 integrator or system administrator) if you determine
a system setup that does not match with the guidelines described here.
