===================
Frontend TypoScript
===================

TypoScript in the frontend is the "glue" between database records edited
by backend editors, and their output to the website.

It is very powerful and this abstraction layer is one reason that the TYPO3
project survives the ever evolving internet since more than 25 years.

The :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>` goes into details about the
usage of TypoScript in the frontend, and the :ref:`TypoScript guide <t3tsref:guide>`
is a kickstart for new TypoScript integrators.
