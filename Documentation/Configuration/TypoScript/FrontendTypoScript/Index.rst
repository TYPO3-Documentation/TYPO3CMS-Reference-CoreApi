===================
Frontend TypoScript
===================

TypoScript in the frontend is the "glue" between database records edited
by backend editors, and their output to the website.

It is very powerful and this abstraction layer is one reason that the TYPO3
project survived the ever evolving internet for more than 25 years.

The :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>` goes into details about the
usage of TypoScript in the frontend, and :ref:`TypoScript in 45 minutes <t3ts45:start>`
is a kickstart for new TypoScript integrators.
