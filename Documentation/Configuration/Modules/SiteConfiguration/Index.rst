    The site configuration gives you an overview of all configured sites

TYPO3 can handle multiple sites within one installation. For example, one
TYPO3 installation might contain a company's web site and a few landing pages
for special products and events.

Even if your TYPO3 installation only contains one site, this site needs to
be configured. This includes the domain used to reach the site,
language related configuration, error handling (for example a custom 404 page)
and the inclusion of "Sets" of settings.

Settings provided by the included sets can be made in
`Site Settings <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:config-overview-backend-site>`_.
