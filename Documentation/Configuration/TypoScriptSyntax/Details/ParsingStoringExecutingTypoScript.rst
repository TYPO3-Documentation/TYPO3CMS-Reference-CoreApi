Parsing TypoScript
==================

This means that the TypoScript text content is transformed into a PHP
array structure by following the rules of the TypoScript syntax. But
still the meaning of the parsed content is not evaluated.

During parsing, syntax errors may occur when the input TypoScript text
content does not follow the rules of the TypoScript syntax. The parser
is however very forgiving in that case and it only registers an error
internally while it will continue to parse the TypoScript code. Syntax
errors can therefore be seen only with a tool that analyzes the syntax
- like the syntax highlighter does.

The :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\Parser\TypoScriptParser` class is used to parse
TypoScript content. Please see the section :ref:`typoscript-syntax-typoscript-parser-api`
in this document for details.

.. _typoscript-syntax-storing-typoscript:

Storing parsed TypoScript
=========================

When TypoScript has been parsed it is stored in a *PHP array* (which
is often serialized and cached in the database afterward).

Consider the following TypoScript:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   asdf = qwerty
   asdf {
     zxcvbnm = uiop
     backgroundColor = blue
     backgroundColor.transparency = 95%
   }

After being parsed, it will be turned into a PHP array looking like
(with the :code:`print_r()` PHP function):

.. code-block:: php

   Array
   (
     [asdf] => qwerty
     [asdf.] => Array
     (
       [zxcvbnm] => uiop
       [backgroundColor] => blue
       [backgroundColor.] => Array
       (
         [transparency] => 95%
       )
     )
   )

This is stored in the internal variable :code:`$this->setup`.

This means you could fetch the value ("blue") of the property
"backgroundColor" with the following code:

.. code-block:: php

   $this->setup['asdf.']['backgroundColor']

**One could say that TypoScript offers a text-based
interface for getting values into a multidimensional PHP
array from a simple text field or file.** This can be very useful if
you need to take that kind of input from users without giving them
direct access to PHP code, which is the very reason why TypoScript came into
existence.


.. index:: TypoScript; Execution
.. _typoscript-syntax-executing-typoscript:

Executing TypoScript
====================

Since TypoScript itself contains only information you cannot
"execute" it. The closest you come to "executing" TypoScript is when
you take the PHP array with the parsed TypoScript structure and pass
it to a PHP function which *then* performs whatever actions according
to the values found in the array.
