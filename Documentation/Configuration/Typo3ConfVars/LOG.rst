===========================
LOG - Logging configuration
===========================

The array :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['LOG']` defines how TYPO3 handles
loggingâ€”what gets logged, how it's formatted, and where it's written.

Depending on your role, there are two relevant guides:

*   For **developers** implementing logging in extensions or custom services,
    see the :ref:`logging` chapter (developer guide).
*   For **system administrators** and **DevOps** configuring logging in
    production environments, see :ref:`production-logging`.

The default logging configuration shipped with TYPO3 can be found in:
:t3src:`core/Configuration/DefaultConfiguration.php`
