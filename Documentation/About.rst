About This Manual
=================


TYPO3 is known for its extensibility. To really benefit from
this power, a complete documentation is needed: "TYPO3 Explained" aims to
provide such information to everyone. Not all areas are covered with the
same amount of detail, but at least some pointers are provided.

The document does *not* contain any significant information about
the frontend of TYPO3. Creating templates, setting up TypoScript
objects etc. is not the scope of the document, it addresses the
*backend* and management part of the Core only.

The TYPO3 Documentation Team hopes that this document will form a complete picture
of the TYPO3 Core architecture. It will hopefully be the knowledge base
of choice in your work with TYPO3.


.. _audience:

Intended Audience
=================

This document is intended to be a reference for TYPO3 CMS developers and partially
for integrators. The document explains all major parts of TYPO3 and the concepts.
Some chapters presumes knowledge in the technical end: PHP, MySQL, Unix etc, depending
on the specific chapter.

The goal is to take you "under the hood" of TYPO3 CMS. To make the
principles and opportunities clear and less mysterious. To educate you
to help continue the development of TYPO3 along the already
established lines so we will have a consistent CMS application in a
future as well. And hopefully this teaching on the deep technical level
will enable you to educate others higher up in the "hierarchy". Please
consider that as well!


.. _code-examples:

Code examples
=============

Many of the code examples found in this document come from the TYPO3
Core itself.

Quite a few others come from the "`styleguide <https://github.com/TYPO3/styleguide>`__"
extension. You can install it, if you want to try out these examples yourself and
use them as a basis for your own extensions.

This manual was originally written by Kasper Skårhøj. It was further
maintained, refreshed and expanded by François Suter.

The first version of the security chapter has been written by Ekkehard Guembel and Michael Hirdes
and we would like to thank them for this. Further thanks to the TYPO3 Security Team for
their work for the TYPO3 project. A special thank goes to Stefan Esser for his books and
articles on PHP security, Jochen Weiland for an initial foundation and Michael Schams
for compiling the content of the security chapter and coordinating the collaboration between
several teams. He managed the whole process of getting the Security Guide to a high quality.


.. _dedication:

Dedication
==========

I want to dedicate this document to the people in the TYPO3 community
who have the  *discipline* to do the boring job of writing
documentation for their extensions or contribute to the TYPO3
documentation in general. It's great to have good coders, but it's
even more important to have coders with character to carry their work
through till the end - even when it means spending days writing good
documents. Go for completeness!
