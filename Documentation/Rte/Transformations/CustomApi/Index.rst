.. _transformations-custom:

Custom transformations API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using the built-in transformations of TYPO3 you can program
your own. This is done by creating a PHP class with two methods for
transformation. Additionally you have to define a key (like
"css\_transform") for your transformation so you can refer to it in
the configuration of Rich Text Editors.


.. _transformations-custom-key:

Custom transformation key
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

You should pick a custom transformation key prefixed by :code:`tx_`,
something like :code:`tx_[extension key]_[suffix]`. The key must **not**
contain dashes (see :ref:`transformations-custom-usage`).

.. note::

   If you pick one of the default transformation keys (except
   the meta-transformations) you will actually *override it* and your
   transformation will be called instead!


.. _transformations-custom-key-registration:

Registering the transformation key in the system
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In :code:`ext_localconf.php`, simply set a :code:`$TYPO3_CONF_VARS` variable
to point to the class which contains the transformation methods::

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['t3lib/class.t3lib_parsehtml_proc.php']['transformation']['tx_examples_transformation']
      = 'Documentation\Examples\Service\RteTransformation';

Here the *transformation key* is defined to be :code:`tx_examples_transformation`
and the value is the fully qualified class name.

This class must contain two public methods, :code:`transform_db()` and
:code:`transform_rte()`.

It must also contain two public variables called by TYPO3 Core
(this is an old part, which doesn't use a proper API):

- :code:`$pObj` which will contain an instance of :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser`.

- :code:`$transformationKey` which should contain your transformation's key
  (in this case :code:`tx_examples_transformation`).


.. _transformations-custom-code:

Code listing
""""""""""""

This code listing shows a simple transformation. When content is
delivered to the RTE it will add a :code:`<hr/>` tag to the end of the
content. When the content is stored in the database any :code:`<hr/>` tag at
the end of the content will be removed and substituted with
whitespace. ::

	class RteTransformation {
		/**
		 * NOTE: must be public as it is accessed by \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser without API
		 *
		 * @var \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser
		 */
		public $pObj;

		/**
		 * NOTE: must be public as it is accessed by \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser without API
		 *
		 * @var string
		 */
		public $transformationKey = 'tx_examples_transformation';

		/**
		 * @var array
		 */
		protected $configuration;

		/**
		 * Loads the transformation's configuration
		 *
		 * @return void
		 */
		protected function loadConfiguration() {
			$this->configuration = $this->pObj->procOptions['usertrans.'][$this->transformationKey . '.'];
		}

		/**
		 * Transforms RTE content prior to database storage
		 *
		 * @param string $value RTE HTML to clean for database storage
		 * @return string
		 */
		public function transform_db($value) {
			$this->loadConfiguration();

			if ($this->configuration['addHrulerInRTE'])    {
				$value = preg_replace('/<hr[[:space:]]*[\/]>[[:space:]]*$/i', '', $value);
			}

			return $value;
		}

		/**
		 * Transforms database content for RTE display
		 *
		 * @param string $value Database content to transform into RTE-ready HTML
		 * @return string
		 */
		public function transform_rte($value) {
			$this->loadConfiguration();

			if ($this->configuration['addHrulerInRTE'])    {
				$value .= '<hr/>';
			}

			return $value;
		}
	}


- The transformation methods :code:`transform_rte` and :code:`transform_db` take
  a single argument which is the value to transform. They have to return
  that value again, modified as needed.

- Notice that both transformation functions call :code:`initConfig()` which uses
  the reference to the parser object to retrieve configuration related to the
  custom transformation.


.. _transformations-custom-usage:

Using the transformation
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The transformation is not yet used. It is only registered. The basic way of applying
it to some rich-text field is to declare it in the "rte\_transform" option of the
:code:`defaultExtras` TCA property. For example, this is what you will find in the
definition of the "poem" field of the "haiku" table from the "examples" extension:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 10,10

	'poem' => array(
		'exclude' => 0,
		'label' => 'LLL:EXT:examples/locallang_db.xml:tx_examples_haiku.poem',
		'config' => array(
			'type' => 'text',
			'cols' => 40,
			'rows' => 6,
			'softref' => 'typolink_tag,images,email[subst],url',
		),
		'defaultExtras' => 'richtext[]:rte_transform[mode=tx_examples_transformation-ts_css]'
	),

The order is important. The order in this list is the order of calling
when the direction is "db". The order is reversed on the way to the RTE.
This means that on the way to the RTE, all transformations covered by "ts\_css"
will happen first and then our custom transformation adds its :code:`<hr/>` tag.
On the way to the database, the opposite happens. The extra :code:`<hr/>` tag is
removed first, then all other transformations are applied.

.. important::

   Notice how transformation keys are separated by a dash ("-") in this case
   and not a comma. This means that your transformation key should **not**
   contain dashes.

However the above code will not work in most cases, because both "rtehtmlarea"
and "css_styled_content" overrule any default processing (using the
:code:`overruleMode` property). In order for the "haiku" table to have its own
custom transformations, it must also be registered as an :code:`overruleMode`
with the following :ref:`Page TSconfig <t3tsconfig:pagetsconfig>`::

	RTE.config.tx_examples_haiku.poem.proc.overruleMode = tx_examples_transformation,ts_css


As a last step we must set the custom option (:code:`addHrulerInRTE`) that
we decided to use in our script. Again in :ref:`Page TSconfig <t3tsconfig:pagetsconfig>`::

   RTE.default.proc.usertrans.tx_examples_transformation.addHrulerInRTE = 1
