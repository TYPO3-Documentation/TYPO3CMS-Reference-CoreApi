Page TSconfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   Some explanations and descriptions may contain slightly obsolete
   references. The principles are still valid though.


The RTEs can be configured by :ref:`Page TSconfig <t3tsconfig:pagetsconfig>`. There is a top level
object named :code:`RTE`, that is used for this. The main object paths looks
like this:

.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         default.[...]

         config.[ *tablename* ].[ *field* ].[...]

         config.[ *tablename* ].[ *field* ].types.[ *type* ].[...]

   Data type
         :ref:`RTEconf <transformations-tsconfig-configuration>`

   Description
         These objects contain the actual configuration of the RTE interface.
         For the properties available, refer to the table below.This is a
         description of how you can customize in general and override for
         specific fields/types.

         :code:`RTE.default` configures the RTE for all tables/fields/types

         :code:`RTE.config.[tablename].[field]` configures a specific field.
         The values inherit the values from :code:`RTE.default` overriding them
         if redefined.

         :code:`RTE.config.[tablename].[field].types.[type]` configures a
         specific field in case the :ref:`type <t3tca:types>`-value of the field matches :code:`type`.
         Again this overrides the former settings.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         [individual RTE options]

   Data type
         -

   Description
         There are other options to set for the :code.`RTE` toplevel object. These
         depend on the individual RTEs. Please refer to their respective manuals.

.. ###### END~OF~TABLE ######


.. _transformations-tsconfig-examples:

Examples
""""""""

This configuration in "Page TSconfig" will disable the RTE altogether::

   RTE.default.disabled = 1

In the case below the RTE is still disabled generally, but this is
overridden specifically for the table "tt\_content" where the RTE is
used in the field "bodytext". The "disabled" flag is set to false
again which means that for Content Elements the RTE will be available. ::

   RTE.default.disabled = 1
   RTE.config.tt_content.bodytext.disabled = 0

In this example the RTE is still enabled for content elements in
generally but if the Content Element type is set to "Text" (text) then
the RTE will be disabled again! ::

   RTE.default.disabled = 1
   RTE.config.tt_content.bodytext.disabled = 0
   RTE.config.tt_content.bodytext.types.text.disabled = 1


.. _transformations-tsconfig-configuration:

RTE configuration
"""""""""""""""""

The RTE object contains configuration of the RTE application. There
are a few properties which are used externally from the RTE. The
property "disabled" will simply disable the rendering of the RTE and
"proc" is reserved to contain additional configuration of
transformations.

.. _transformations-tsconfig-configuration-disabled:

disabled
~~~~~~~~

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         disabled

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         If set, the editor is disabled.

         This option is evaluated in :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Form\FormEngine` where it determines
         whether the RTE is rendered or not.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-configuration-proc:

proc
~~~~

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         proc

   Data type
         :ref:`proc <transformations-tsconfig-processing>`

   Description
         Customization of the server processing of the content - also called
         'transformations'. :ref:`See table below <transformations-tsconfig-processing>`.

         The transformations are only initialized, if they are configured
         (:code:`rte_transform` must be set for the field in the
         :ref:`types definition in TCA <t3tca:types>`).

         The :code:`proc` object is processed in :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser` and is
         *independant* of the particular RTE used (like transformations generally are!).


.. _transformations-tsconfig-configuration-specific:

RTE-specific
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         [individual RTE options]

   Data type
         -

   Description
         Each RTE may use additional properties for the RTE.
         Please refer to their respective manuals.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing:

Processing configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""

This object contains configuration of the transformations used. These
options are *universal for all RTEs* and used inside the class
:code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser`.

The main objective of these options is to allow for minor
configuration of the transformations. For instance you may disable the
mapping between :code:`<b>-<strong>` and :code:`<i>-<em>` tags which is done by the
'ts\_transform' transformation. Or you could disable the default
transfer of images from external URL to the local server. This is all
possible through the options.

Notice how many properties relate to specific transformations only!
Also notice that the meta-transformations "ts\_css" imply
other transformations :ref:`as explained in the overview <transformations-overview-meta>`.
This means that options limited to "ts\_transform" will also work for "ts\_css"
of course.

.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-overrulemode:

overruleMode
~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         overruleMode

   Data type
         List of RTE transformations

   Description
         This can overrule the RTE transformation set from TCA.

         Notice, this is a  *comma list* of transformation keys. (Not a "dash-
         list" like in $TCA).



.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-allowtagsoutside:

allowTagsOutside
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         allowTagsOutside

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         divideIntoLines))*

         Enter tags which are allowed outside of <P> and <DIV> sections when
         converted back to database.

         Default is "img"

         Example:

         IMG,HR



.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-allowtags:

allowTags
~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         allowTags

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         getKeepTags))*

         Tags to allow. Notice, this list is  *added* to the default list,
         which you see here:

         b,i,u,a,img,br,div,center,pre,font,hr,sub,sup,p,strong,em,li,ul,ol,blo
         ckquote,strike,span

         If you wish to deny some tags, see below.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-denytags:

denyTags
~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         denyTags

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         getKeepTags))*

         Tags from above list to disallow.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-blockelementlist:

blockElementList
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         blockElementList

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         Comma-separated list of uppercase tags (e.g. :code:`P,HR`) that
         overrides the list of HTML elements that will be treated as block elements
         by the RTE transformations.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-htmlparser:

HTMLparser\_rte, HTMLparser\_db
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         HTMLparser\_rte

         HTMLparser\_db

   Data type
         :ref:`HTMLparser <t3tsref:htmlparser>`

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         getKeepTags))*

         This is additional options to the HTML-parser calls which strips of
         tags when the content is prepared for the RTE and DB respectively. You
         can configure additional rules, like which other tags to preserve,
         which attributes to preserve, which values are allowed as attributes
         of a certain tag etc.

         .. note::

            This configuration is similar in TypoScript and Page TSconfig.
            This is why the link for the "data type" points to the TypoScript
            reference.

         .. note::

            The :ref:`HTMLparser <t3tsref:htmlparser>` options, :code:`keepNonMatchedTags` and
            :code:`htmlSpecialChars` are **not** observed. They are preset internally.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-dontremoveunknowntags_db:

dontRemoveUnknownTags\_db
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         dontRemoveUnknownTags\_db

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         HTMLcleaner\_db))*

         Direction: To database

         Default is to remove all unknown tags in the content going to the
         database. (See HTMLparser\_db above for default tags). Generally this
         is a very usefull thing, because all kinds of bogus tags from pasted
         content like that from Word etc. will be removed to have clean content
         in the database.

         However this disables that and allows all tags, that are not in the
         HTMLparser\_db-list.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-allowedclasses:

allowedClasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         allowedClasses

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_transform" and "css\_transform" only (function
         getKeepTags))*

         Direction: To DB

         Allowed general classnames when content is stored in database. Could
         be a list matching the number of defined classes you have.Case-
         insensitive.

         This might be a really good idea to do, because when pasting in
         content from MS word for instance there are a lot of <SPAN> and <P>
         tags which may have class-names in. So by setting a list of allowed
         classes, such foreign classnames are removed.

         If a classname is not found in this list, the default is to remove the
         class-attribute.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-keeppdivattribs:

keepPDIVattribs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         keepPDIVattribs

   Data type
         string with comma separated values

   Description
         Comma separated list of tag attributes

         *(Applies for `ts_transform` and `css_transform` only (function
         divideIntoLines))*

         "align" and "class" are the only attributes preserved for <P>/<DIV>
         tags. Here you can specify a list of other attributes to preserve.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-dontfetchextpictures:

dontFetchExtPictures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         dontFetchExtPictures

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_images")*

         If set, images from external urls are not fetched for the page if
         content is pasted from external sources. Normally this process of
         copying is done.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-plainimagemode:

plainImageMode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         plainImageMode

   Data type
         boolean/string

   Description
         *(Applies for "ts\_images")*

         If set, all "plain" local images (those that are not magic images)
         will be cleaned up in some way.

         If the value is just set, then the style attribute will be removed
         after detecting any special width/height CSS attributes (which is what
         the RTE will set if you scale the image manually) and the border
         attribute is set to zero.

         You can also configure with special keywords. So setting
         "plainImageMode" to any of the value below will perform special
         processing:

         "lockDimensions" : This will read the real dimensions of the image
         file and force these values into the <img> tag. Thus this option will
         prevent any user applied scaling in the image!

         "lockRatio" : This will allow users to scale the image but will
         automatically correct the height dimension so the aspect ratio from
         the original image file is preserved.

         "lockRatioWhenSmaller" : Like "lockRatio", but will not allow any
         scaling larger than the original size of the image.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-exit_entry_htmlparser:

exitHTMLparser, entryHTMLparser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         exitHTMLparser\_rte

         exitHTMLparser\_db

         entryHTMLparser\_rte

         entryHTMLparser\_db

   Data type
         boolean/:ref:`HTMLparser <t3tsref:htmlparser>`

   Description
         *(Applies for all kinds of processing)*

         Allows you to enable/disable the :ref:`HTMLparser <t3tsref:htmlparser>`
         for the content before (entry) and after (exit) the content is processed
         with the predefined processors (e.g. ts\_images or ts\_transform).

         There are no default values set.


.. _transformations-tsconfig-processing-user:

User transformations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         usertrans.[user-defined transformation key]

   Data type
         -

   Description
         Custom option-space for userdefined transformations.

         See example from section about custom transformations.
