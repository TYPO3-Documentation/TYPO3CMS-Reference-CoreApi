=======================================
:file:`composer.json`
=======================================

*-- required* in Composer-based installations

.. note::

   While the file :file:`composer.json` is currently not strictly required
   for an extension to function properly in legacy non-Composer installations
   it is recommended to keep it in any public extension that is published to
   TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).

Including a :file:`composer.json` is strongly recommended for a number of reasons:

#. The file :file:`composer.json` is required for documentation rendering since
   May 29, 2019.

   See :ref:`h2document:migrate` for more information on the necessary changes for
   extension documentation rendering.

#. Working with Composer in general is strongly recommended for TYPO3.

   If you are not using Composer for your projects yet, see :ref:`t3install:migratetocomposer`
   in the "Installation & Upgrade Guide".

.. _ext-composer-json-minimal:

Minimal composer.json
=====================

This is a minimal composer.json for a TYPO3 extension:

* The vendor name is *MyVendor*
* The extension key is *my_extension*

Subsequently:

* The namespace will be *MyVendor\\MyExtension*
* The package name will be *my-vendor/my-extension*

.. versionchanged:: 11.4
   The ordering of installed extensions and their dependencies are loaded from
   the :file:`composer.json` file, instead of :file:`ext_emconf.php` in
   Composer-based installations.

.. note::
   Extension authors should ensure that the information in the :file:`composer.json`
   file is in sync with the one in the extensions' :file:`ext_emconf.php` file.
   This is especially important regarding constraints like `depends` , `conflicts`
   and `suggests`. Use the equivalent settings in :file:`composer.json` `require`,
   `conflict` and `suggest` to set dependencies and ensure a specific loading order.

.. _ext-composer-json-properties:

Properties
==========

name
----

(*required*)

`<my-vendor>/<dashed extension key>` "Dashed extension key" means that every underscore (`_`) has been changed to a dash (`-`).
You must be owner of the vendor name and should register it on packagist.
Typically, the name will correspond to your namespaces used in the :file:`Classes` folder,
but with different uppercase / lowercase spelling,
e.g. `GeorgRinger\News` namespace and `georgringer/news` name in :file:`composer.json`.

description
-----------

(*required*)

Description of your extension (1 line)

type
----

(*required*)

Use `typo3-cms-extension` for third party extensions. This will result in
the extension to be installed in `{web-dir}/typo3conf/ext` instead
of `vendor/{vendor}/{package}`.

Use `typo3-cms-framework` for system extensions. They will be installed
in `web-dir/typo3/sysext`.

See `typo3/cms-composer-installers <https://github.com/TYPO3/CmsComposerInstallers>`__
(required by `typo3/cms-core`).

license
-------

(*recommended*)

Has to be `GPL-2.0-only` or `GPL-2.0-or-later`.
See: https://typo3.org/project/licenses/.


require
-------

(*required*)

At the least, you will want to require `typo3/cms-core`.
You should add other system extensions and third party extensions,
if your extension depends on them.

In Composer-based installations the loading order of extensions and their
dependencies is derived from :js:`require` and :js:`suggest`



suggest
-------

You should add other system extensions and third party extensions,
if your extension has an optional dependency on them.

In Composer-based installations the loading order of extensions and their
dependencies is derived from :js:`require` and :js:`suggest`


autoload
--------

(*required*)

Define namespace - path mapping for PSR-4 autoloading.
In TYPO3 we follow the convention that all classes (except test classes)
are in the directory :file:`Classes`.

extra
-----

(*required*)

Not providing this property will emit a deprecation notice and will fail in
future versions.

.. hint::

   The property "extension-key" means the **literal string** "extension-key",
   not your actual extension key. The value on the right side should be your
   actual extension key.

Example for extension key **bootstrap_package**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "extra": {
         "typo3/cms": {
            "extension-key": "bootstrap_package"
         }
      }
   }

Properties no longer used
=========================

version
-------

Was used in earlier TYPO3 versions.
For TYPO3 versions 7.6 and above you should not use the version property.
The version for the extension is set in the file :ref:`ext_emconf.php <ext_emconf-php>`.
`Composer primarily takes the version information from repository tags <https://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#library-versioning>`__,
so the releases need to be tagged in the VCS repository with a version number.

replace with ``typo3-ter`` vendor name
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "replace": {
         "typo3-ter/bootstrap-package": "self.version"
      }
   }

This was used previously as long as the TER Composer Repository was
relevant. Since the TER Composer Repository is deprecated, the `typo3-ter/*` entry
within `replace` is not required.

replace with ``"ext_key": "self.version"``
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "replace": {
         "ext_key": "self.version"
      }
   }

This was used previously, but is not compatible with latest Composer
versions and will result in a warning using `composer validate` or
result in an error with Composer version >=2.0:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ Deprecation warning: replace.ext_key is invalid, it should have a vendor name, a forward slash, and a package name.
     The vendor and package name can be words separated by -, . or _. The complete name should match
     "^[a-z0-9]([_.-]?[a-z0-9]+)*/[a-z0-9](([_.]?|-{0,2})[a-z0-9]+)*$".
     Make sure you fix this as Composer 2.0 will error.
