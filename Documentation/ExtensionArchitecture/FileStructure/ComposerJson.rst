Introduction
============

`Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__ is a tool for dependency management in
PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your extension depends on and it
will manage (install/update) them for you.

..  note::
    While the file :file:`composer.json` is currently not strictly required
    for an extension to function properly in legacy non-Composer installations
    it is recommended to keep it in any public extension that is published to
    `TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) <https://extensions.typo3.org/>`__.

Including a :file:`composer.json` is strongly recommended for a number of
reasons:

#.  The file :file:`composer.json` is required for documentation that should
    appear on `docs.typo3.org <https://docs.typo3.org/>`__.

    See :ref:`h2document:migrate` for more information on the necessary changes
    for rendering of extension documentation.

#.  Working with Composer in general is strongly recommended for TYPO3.

    If you are not using Composer for your projects yet, see
    :ref:`t3install:migratetocomposer` in the "Upgrade Guide".


..  _ext-composer-json-minimal:

Minimal composer.json
=====================

This is a minimal :file:`composer.json` for a TYPO3 extension:

*   The vendor name is `MyVendor`.
*   The :ref:`extension key <extension-key>` is `my_extension`.

Subsequently:

*   The PHP namespace will be :php:`MyVendor\MyExtension`
*   The Composer package name will be `my-vendor/my-extension`

..  literalinclude:: _ComposerJson/_MinimalComposer.json
    :language: json
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/composer.json

* see `composer.json schema <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md>`__ for
  general Composer information
* see :ref:`ext-composer-json-properties` below for TYPO3 specific hints

..  versionchanged:: 11.4
    The ordering of installed extensions and their dependencies are loaded from
    the :file:`composer.json` file, instead of :file:`ext_emconf.php` in
    Composer-based installations.

..  note::
    Extension authors should ensure that the information in the
    :file:`composer.json` file is in sync with the one in the extension's
    :ref:`ext_emconf.php <ext_emconf-php>` file. This is especially important
    regarding constraints like :php:`depends`, :php:`conflicts` and
    :php:`suggests`. Use the equivalent settings in :file:`composer.json`
    `require`, `conflict` and `suggest` to set dependencies and ensure a
    specific loading order.


..  _ext-composer-json-extended:

Extended composer.json
======================

..  seealso::
    Please see :ref:`testing-extensions` for
    further changes to :file:`composer.json` for testing extensions.

*   See `composer.json schema <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md>`__ for
    general Composer information.
*   See :ref:`ext-composer-json-properties` below for TYPO3-specific hints.


..  _ext-composer-json-properties:

Properties
==========

name
----

(*required*)

The name has the format: `<my-vendor>/<dashed extension key>`. "Dashed extension
key" means that every underscore (`_`) has been changed to a dash (`-`).
You must be owner of the vendor name and should register it on
`Packagist <https://packagist.org/>`__. Typically, the name will correspond to
your namespaces used in the :file:`Classes/` folder, but with different
uppercase / lowercase spelling, for example: The PHP namespace
:php:`JohnDoe\SomeExtension` may be `johndoe/some-extension` in
:file:`composer.json`.

description
-----------

(*required*)

Description of your extension (1 line).

type
----

(*required*)

Use `typo3-cms-extension` for third-party extensions. This results in the
extension to be installed in :file:`{web-dir}/typo3conf/ext/` instead of
:file:`vendor/{vendor}/{package}`.

Additionally, `typo3-cms-framework` is available for system extensions. They
will be installed in :file:`web-dir/typo3/sysext/`.

See `typo3/cms-composer-installers <https://github.com/TYPO3/CmsComposerInstallers>`__
(required by `typo3/cms-core`).

license
-------

(*recommended*)

Has to be `GPL-2.0-only` or `GPL-2.0-or-later`.
See: https://typo3.org/project/licenses/.


require
-------

(*required*)

At least, you will need to require `typo3/cms-core` in the according version(s).
You should add other system extensions and third-party extensions, if your
extension depends on them.

In Composer-based installations the loading order of extensions and their
dependencies is derived from `require` and `suggest`.



suggest
-------

You should add other system extensions and third-party extensions, if your
extension has an optional dependency on them.

In Composer-based installations the loading order of extensions and their
dependencies is derived from `require` and `suggest`.


autoload
--------

(*required*)

The autoload section defines the namespace/path mapping for
`PSR-4 autoloading <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/>`. In TYPO3 we follow
the convention that all classes (except test classes) are in the directory
:file:`Classes/`.

extra.typo3/cms.extension-key
-----------------------------

(*required*)

Not providing this property will emit a deprecation notice and will fail in
future versions.

..  hint::
    The property `extension-key` means the **literal string** `extension-key`,
    not your actual extension key. The value on the right side should be your
    actual extension key.

Example for extension key `my_extension`:

..  literalinclude:: _ComposerJson/_ExtensionKey.json
    :language: json
    :caption: Excerpt of EXT:my_extension/composer.json


Properties no longer used
=========================

replace with ``typo3-ter`` vendor name
--------------------------------------

..  literalinclude:: _ComposerJson/_ReplaceTypo3Ter.json
    :language: json
    :caption: Excerpt of EXT:my_extension/composer.json

This was used previously as long as the TER Composer Repository was
relevant. Since the TER Composer Repository is deprecated, the `typo3-ter/*` entry
within `replace` is not required.

replace with ``"ext_key": "self.version"``
------------------------------------------

..  literalinclude:: _ComposerJson/_ReplaceExtKey.json
    :language: json
    :caption: Excerpt of EXT:my_extension/composer.json

This was used previously, but is not compatible with latest Composer
versions and will result in a warning using `composer validate` or
result in an error with Composer version 2.0+:

..  code-block:: text

    Deprecation warning: replace.ext_key is invalid, it should have a vendor name, a forward slash, and a package name.
    The vendor and package name can be words separated by -, . or _. The complete name should match
    "^[a-z0-9]([_.-]?[a-z0-9]+)*/[a-z0-9](([_.]?|-{0,2})[a-z0-9]+)*$".
    Make sure you fix this as Composer 2.0 will error.

TYPO3-specific:

*   The :ref:`section on testing <testing-extensions>` (in this manual) contains
    further information about adding additional properties to
    :file:`composer.json` that are relevant for testing.
*   The Composer plugin (not extension)
    `typo3/cms-composer-installers <https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-composer-installers>`__
    is responsible for TYPO3-specific Composer installation. Reading the README
    file and source code can be helpful to understand how it works.
