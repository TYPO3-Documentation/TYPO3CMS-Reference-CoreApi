========================
Creating a new extension
========================

First choose a unique `Composer name <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#name>`__
for your extension. Additionally, an extension key is required.

If you plan to ever publish your extension in the TYPO3 Extension Repository
(TER), :ref:`register an extension key <extension-key>`.

Kickstarting the extension
==========================

There are different options to kickstart an extension. You can create it from
scratch or follow one of our :ref:`tutorials on kickstarting an
extension <extension-kickstart>`.

Installing the newly created extension
=======================================

Starting with TYPO3 v11 it is no longer possible to install extensions in TYPO3
without using Composer in Composer-based installations.

However during development it is necessary to test your extension locally
before publishing it. Place the extension directory into the directory called,
:file:`packages` inside of the TYPO3 project root directory.

Then edit your projects :file:`composer.json <extension-composer-json>` (The one in the TYPO3 root
directory, **not the one in the extension**) and add the following repository:

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: composer.json

   {
      "repositories": [
         {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "packages/*"
         }
      ]
   }

After that you can install your extension via Composer:

..  code-block:: bash

    composer req my-vendor/my-extension:"@dev"

..  hint::
    Starting with TYPO3 v11.5 all extensions installed via Composer are
    automatically activated when they are installed.

..  hint::
    For Classic mode installations you can put the extension directly in the directory
    :file:`typo3conf/ext` and then **activate** it in
    :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions`.
