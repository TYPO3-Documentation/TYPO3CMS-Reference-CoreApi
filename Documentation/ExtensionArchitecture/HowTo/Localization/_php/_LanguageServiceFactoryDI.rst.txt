    * This middleware can be used to retrieve a list of seasons with their according translation.
    * To get the correct translation the URL must be within a base path defined in site

    * "/en/haiku-season-list.json" for English translation (if /en is the configured base path)
    * "/de/haiku-season-list.json" for German translation (if /de is the configured base path)
    * If the base path is not available in the according site the default language will be used.
