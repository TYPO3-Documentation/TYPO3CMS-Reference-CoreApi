====================
Localization in PHP
====================

Sometimes you have to localize a string in PHP code, for
example inside of a controller or a ViewHelper.

Localization in Extbase context
===============================

In :ref:`Extbase <extbase>` context you can use the method
`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\LocalizationUtility::translate($key, $extensionName)`.

This method requires the localization key as the first and the extension's
name as optional second parameter. Then the corresponding text in the current
language will be loaded from this extension's :file:`locallang.xlf` file.

The method :php:`translate()` takes translation overrides from TypoScript into
account. See :ref:`localization-typoscript-LOCAL_LANG`.
