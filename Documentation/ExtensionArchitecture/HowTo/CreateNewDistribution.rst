===========================
Creating a new distribution
===========================

This chapter describes the main steps in creating a new distribution.


.. _distribution_concept:

Concept of distributions
========================

The distributions are full TYPO3 CMS websites that only need to be unpacked.
They offer a simple and quick introduction to the use of the TYPO3 CMS. The
best known distribution is the :t3ext:`introduction`.
Distributions are easiest to install via the :ref:`Extension Manager <extension-manager>` (EM)
under "Get preconfigured distribution".

A distribution is just an extension enriched with some further data that is
loaded or executed upon installing that extension. A distribution takes
care of the following parts:

- Deliver initial database data

- Deliver fileadmin files

- Deliver configuration for a package

- Hook into the process after saving configuration to
  trigger actions dependent on configuration values

- Deliver dependent extensions if needed (e.g., customized versions or
  extensions not available through TER)


.. _distribution-kickstart:

Kickstarting the Distribution
=============================

A distribution is a special kind of extension. The first step
is thus to create a new extension.
Start by registering an :ref:`extension key <extension-key>`,
which will be the unique identifier of your distribution.

Next create the :ref:`extension declaration file <extension-declaration>` as usual,
except for the "category" property which must be set to
**distribution**.


.. _distribution-kickstart-image:

Configuring the Distribution Display in the EM
----------------------------------------------

You should provide two preview images for your distribution. Provide
a small 220x150 pixels for the list in the Extension Manager as
:file:`Resources/Public/Images/Distribution.png` and a larger 300x400 pixels
welcome image as :file:`Resources/Public/Images/DistributionWelcome.png`.
The welcome image is displayed in the distribution detail view inside the Extension Manager.


.. _distribution-kickstart-fileadmin:

Fileadmin Files
---------------

Create the following folder structure inside your extension:

- :file:`Initialisation`
- :file:`Initialisation/Files`

All the files inside that second folder will be copied to
:file:`fileadmin/<extkey>` during installation, where "extkey" is
the extension key of your distribution.

A good strategy for files (as followed by the Introduction Package) is to construct
the distribution so that it can be uninstalled and removed from the file system
after the initial import.

To achieve that, when creating content for your distribution, all your
content related files (assets) should be located within :file:`fileadmin/<extkey>`
in the first place, and content elements or other records should reference
these files via FAL. A good export preset will then contain the content
related assets within your dump.

If there are files not directly referenced in tables selected for export
(for example ext:form .yml form configurations), you can locate them
within :file:`fileadmin/<extkey>`, too. Only those need to be copied to
:file:`Initialization/Files` - all other files referenced in database rows
will be within your export dump.

Note that you should *not* put your website configuration
(TypoScript files, JavaScript, CSS, logos, etc.) in :file:`fileadmin/`,
which is intended for editors only, but in a separate extension.
In the case of the Introduction Package, the configuration is located in the
:t3ext:`bootstrap_package`
extension, and the Introduction Package depends on it. In this way,
the Introduction Package provides only the database dump and asset files which
results in only content-related files being in :file:`fileadmin/`,
which are provided by the Introduction Package.

.. _distribution-kickstart-site:

Site configuration
------------------

In order to import a site configuration upon installation, supply a site config file
to :file:`Initialisation/Site/<SITE_IDENTIFIER>/config.yaml`.

.. note::

    Existing site configuration folders with the same identifier will neither be overwritten nor changed.
    See :doc:`ext_core:Changelog/10.1/Feature-89010-IntroduceSiteConfigForDistributionPackages`


.. _distribution-kickstart-database:

Database Data
-------------

The database data is delivered as TYPO3 CMS export file under :file:`Initialisation/data.xml`.

Generate this file by exporting your whole TYPO3 instance
from the root of the page tree using the :ref:`export module <ext_impexp:export>`:

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. Page tree

   Open the export module by right-clicking on the root of the page tree and
   selecting :guilabel:`More Options > Export`.

#. Export module: Configuration

   Select the tables to be included in the export: It should include all tables
   except :sql:`be_users` and :sql:`sys_log`.

   Relations to all tables should be included, whereas static relations should
   not. Static relations are only useful if the related records already exist
   in the target TYPO3 instance. This is not the case with distributions
   that initialize the target TYPO3 instance.

   Fine-tune the export configuration by evaluating the
   list of records at the bottom of the page under "Inside pagetree":
   This is a precalculation of the records to be included in the export.

   Do not forget to click :guilabel:`Update` before proceeding to the next tab.

#. Export module: Advanced Options

   Check :guilabel:`Save files in extra folder beside the export file` to save
   files (e.g. images), referenced in database data, in a separate folder
   instead of directly in the export file .

#. Export module: File & Preset

   Insert meaningful metadata under *Meta data*.
   The file name must be "data" and the file format must be set to "XML".

   To reuse your export configuration during ongoing distribution development,
   you should now save it as a preset. Choose a descriptive title and click
   the :guilabel:`Save` button. A record will be created in the
   :sql:`tx_impexp_presets` table.

   Currently, after saving the export configuration, you jump to the first tab,
   so navigate back to the :guilabel:`File & Preset` tab.

   To finish the export, click the :guilabel:`Save to filename` button. Copy
   the export file from :file:`/fileadmin/user_upload/_temp_/importtexport/data.xml`
   to the distribution folder under :file:`Initialization/data.xml`.

   If referenced files were exported, copy the
   :file:`fileadmin/user_upload/_temp_/importtexport/data.xml.files/` folder
   containing the files with hashed filenames to the distribution folder
   under :file:`initialization/data.xml.files/`.

.. note::

   Any extensions that are not required by the distribution should be deactivated
   before the export task is executed.

.. note::

   By default, any file that has an entry in the :sql:`sys_file` table will be
   exported, including files in the :file:`fileadmin/user_upload/_temp/` path where
   previous exports were stored that you do not want included in the export.

   Therefore, delete any temporary files that you do not want to export from the
   fileadmin. Use the :guilabel:`Filelist` module to delete these files.
   If you delete them directly from the file system, the corresponding entries in
   :sql:`sys_file` will not be deleted and an error will occur during export,
   which must then be corrected directly by manually deleting the database entries.

.. note::

    A TYPO3 issue prevents loading :file:`data.xml` larger than
    10MB. In this case the only option left is going with :file:`data.t3d`

.. warning::

    Do *not* include backend users in the dump! If you do, you end up
    having your user on other systems who loaded your distribution. Give
    the export a special check in this area. Having your backend user
    in the dump is most likely a security vulnerability of your distribution
    if that distribution is uploaded to the public.

.. seealso::

   The Introduction Package comes with a maintained export preset within its
   `database export <https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/introduction/blob/master/Initialisation/data.xml>`_
   which can be useful as a kick start. Just import that preset into your
   installation and adapt to the needs of your distribution. The import works
   similar to the export.

   The export preset is configured as:

   * Export database data as :file:`data.xml`
   * Export only referenced FAL file relations into :file:`data.xml.files` directory,
     do not just export *all* files from fileadmin
   * Do not export :sql:`be_users` (!)
   * Do not export some other tables like :sql:`sys_log` and friends


.. _distribution-kickstart-configuration:

Distribution Configuration
--------------------------

A distribution is technically handled as an extension. Therefore you
can make use of all :ref:`configuration options <extension-options>` as needed.

After installing the extension, the event :ref:`AfterPackageActivationEvent<AfterPackageActivationEvent>` is
dispatched. You may use this to alter your website configuration (e.g. color
scheme) on the fly.

.. _distribution-testing:

Test Your Distribution
======================

To test your distribution, copy your extension to an empty
TYPO3 CMS installation and try to install it from the Extension
Manager.

To test a distribution locally without uploading to TER, just install
a blank TYPO3 (last step in installer "Just get me to the Backend"),
then go to Extension Manager, select "Get extensions" once to let the
Extension Manager initialize the extension list (this is needed if your
distribution has dependencies to other extensions, for instance the Introduction Package
depends on the Bootstrap Package). Next, copy or move the distribution extension
to :file:`typo3conf/ext`, it will then show up in Extension Manager default
tab "Installed Extensions".

Install the distribution extension from there. The Extension Manager will then resolve
TER dependencies, load the database dump and handle the file operations.
Under the hood, this does the same as later installing the distribution
via "Get preconfigured distribution", when it has been uploaded or updated in
TER, with the only difference that you can provide and test the distribution
locally *without* uploading to TER first.

.. warning::

   It is not enough to clean all files and the page tree if you want to
   try again to install your distribution. Indeed, TYPO3 CMS remembers that it
   previously imported your distribution and will skip any known files and
   the database import. Make sure to clean the table "sys_registry" if you want
   to work around that, or, even better, install a new blank TYPO3 to test again.
   Tip: Optimize creating the empty TYPO3 instance with a script, you probably
   end up testing the import a couple of times until you are satisfied with the result.
