==========
Repository
==========

All :ref:`Extbase <extbase>` repositories inherit from
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository`.

A repository is always responsible for precisely one type of
:ref:`domain object <extbase-model>`.

The naming of the repositories is important:
If the domain object is, for example, *Blog* (with full name
:php:`\FriendsOfTYPO3\BlogExample\Domain\Model\Blog`),
then the corresponding repository is named *BlogRepository* (with the full name
:php:`\FriendsOfTYPO3\BlogExample\Domain\Repository\BlogRepository`).

The :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository` already offers a large
number of useful functions. Therefore, in simple classes that extend the
:php:`Repository` class and leaving the class empty otherwise is sufficient.

The :php:`BlogRepository` sets some default orderings and is otherwise empty:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Extbase/Domain/BlogRepository.rst.txt

..  contents:: **Table of contents**
    :local:


..  _extbase-repository-find-methods:

Find methods
============

..  versionchanged:: 14.0
    The "magic" find methods `findByX()`, `findOneByX()` and `countByX()` have
    been removed. See :ref:`t3coreapi/13:extbase-repository-find-by-magic-migration`

The :php:`Repository` class provides the following methods for querying against
arbitrary criteria:

:php:`findBy(array $criteria, array $orderBy = null, int $limit = null, int $offset = null): QueryResultInterface`
   Finds all objects with the provided criteria.

:php:`findOneBy(array $criteria, array $orderBy = null): object|null`
   Returns the first object found with the provided criteria.

:php:`count(array $criteria): int`
   Counts all objects with the provided criteria.

Example:

..  code-block:: php

    $this->blogRepository->findBy(['author' => 1, 'published' => true]);

..  _extbase-repository-find-by-custom:

Custom find methods
===================

Custom find methods can be implemented. They can be used for complex queries.

..  attention::
    As Extbase repositories turn the results into objects, querying large
    amounts of data is resource-intensive.

**Example:**

The :php:`PostRepository` of the :composer:`t3docs/blog-example` example extension implements
several custom find methods, two of them are shown below:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Extbase/Domain/CustomMethods.rst.txt

..  _extbase-repository-query-setting:

Query settings
===============

If the query settings should be used for all methods in the repository,
they should be set in the method :php:`initializeObject()` method.

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Extbase/Domain/DefaultQuerySettings.rst.txt

..  attention::
    Depending on the query settings, hidden or even deleted objects can become
    visible. This might cause sensitive information to be disclosed. Use with care.

If you only want to change the query settings for a specific method, they can be
set in the method itself:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Extbase/Domain/SpecialQuerySettings.rst.txt

..  _extbase-repository-api:

Repository API
===============

..  _extbase-repository-localization:

Typo3QuerySettings and localization
===================================

Extbase renders the translated records in the same way as TypoScript rendering.

..  versionchanged:: 12.0
    The Extbase query settings rely on
    :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Context\LanguageAspect` now.

The following methods can be used to set and get the :ref:`language aspect <context_api_aspects_language>`  from any
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Generic\QuerySettingsInterface`:

-   :php:`QuerySettingsInterface::getLanguageAspect(): LanguageAspect`
-   :php:`QuerySettingsInterface::setLanguageAspect(LanguageAspect $aspect)`

You can specify a custom language aspect per query as defined in the query settings
in any repository class:

Example to use the fallback to the default language when working with overlays:

..  literalinclude:: _Repository/_LanguageAspect.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Repository/MyRepository.php

..  _extbase-repository-debug-query:

Debugging an Extbase query
==========================

When using complex queries in Extbase repositories it sometimes comes handy
to debug them using the Extbase debug utilities.

..  literalinclude:: _Repository/_DebugQuery.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Repository/MyRepository.php

Please note that :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Generic\Storage\Typo3DbQueryParser`
is marked as `@internal` and subject to unannounced changes.
