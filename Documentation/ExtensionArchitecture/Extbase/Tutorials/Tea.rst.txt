=================
Tea in a Nutshell
=================

The example extension :t3ext:`tea` was created as an example of best practises
on automatic code checks.

..  hint::
    If you want to learn more about automatic code checks
    see the :doc:`documentation of tea <ext_tea:Index>` and the chapter on
    :ref:`Testing <testing>` in this manual.

In this manual, however we will ignore the testing and just explain how this
simple and very well tested example extension works.

..  attention::
    The example extension tea should not be used as a kickstarter or
    template for your own extension. It is simply an example to be
    studied and copied from.

Create an extension
===================

For an extension to be installable via composer it needs a file called
:file:`composer.json`. You can read more about this file here:
:ref:`files-composer-json`.
