=======
Extbase
=======

Extbase is an extension framework to create TYPO3 frontend plugins and TYPO3
backend modules. Extbase can be used to develop extensions but it does not
have to be used.

Extbase is included in the TYPO3 Core as system extension :php:`extbase`.

There are also tutorials in the :ref:`Extension Development -
Tutorials <extension-tutorials>` section.

.. TODO: Most of Extbase is still not documented.
