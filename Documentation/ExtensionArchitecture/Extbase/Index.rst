Extbase
=======

Extbase is an extension framework to create TYPO3 frontend plugins and TYPO3
backend modules. Extbase can be used to develop extensions but it does not
have to be used.

Extbase is included in the TYPO3 Core as system extension :php:`extbase`.

You can find an extended tutorial in the tutorial :doc:`t3extbasebook:Index`.

.. TODO: Most of Extbase is still not documented.
