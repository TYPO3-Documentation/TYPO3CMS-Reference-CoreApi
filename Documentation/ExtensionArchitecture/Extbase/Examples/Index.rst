Example extensions
==================

Tea example
-----------

The extension :t3ext:`tea`, is based on Extbase and Fluid. The
extension features a range of best practices in relation to automated code checks,
unit/functional/acceptance testing and continuous integration.

You can also use this extension to manage your collection of delicious teas.

Blog example
------------

The extension :t3ext:`blog_example` contains working examples of all the features documented in the :ref:`Extbase Reference <extbase_reference>` manual.

This extension should not be used as a base for building your own extension or used to blog in a live environment.

If you want to set up a blog, take a look at the :t3ext:`blog` extension or combine :t3ext:`news` with a comment extension of your choice.
