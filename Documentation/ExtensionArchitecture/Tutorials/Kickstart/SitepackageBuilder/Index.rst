Sitepackage Builder
===================

The main incentive of the `Sitepackage Builder <https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/>`__
is a quick and easy way to create a new sitepackage, what would be called
"theme" in other CMS, for your project. See the
:ref:`Sitepackage Tutorial <t3sitepackage:start>` for details on sitepackages.
