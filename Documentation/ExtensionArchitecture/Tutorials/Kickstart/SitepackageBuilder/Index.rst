Sitepackage Builder
===================

Kickstart a TYPO3 Extension with the "Sitepackage Builder"
==========================================================

The `Sitepackage Builder <https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/>` can also be
used to kickstart a basic extension. You can do so by choosing the
:guilabel:`Fluid Styled Content` as base package and then remove all files
and dependencies that are not needed.

See :ref:`Kickstart a Minimal Extension with the Sitepackage Builder <extension-minimal>`.
