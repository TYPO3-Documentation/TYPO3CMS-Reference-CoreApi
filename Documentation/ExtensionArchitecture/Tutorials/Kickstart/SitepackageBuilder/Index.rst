===================
Sitepackage Builder
===================

The main incentive of the `Sitepackage Builder <https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/>`__
is a quick and easy way to create a new sitepackage, what would be called
"theme" in other CMS, for your project. See the
:ref:`Sitepackage Tutorial <t3sitepackage:start>` for details on sitepackages.

Kickstart a TYPO3 Extension with the "Sitepackage Builder"
==========================================================

The `Sitepackage Builder <https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/>`__ can also be
used to kickstart a basic extension. You can do so by choosing
:guilabel:`Fluid Styled Content` as base package and then remove all files
and dependencies that are not needed.

See :ref:`Kickstart a Minimal Extension with the Sitepackage
Builder <extension-minimal>`.
