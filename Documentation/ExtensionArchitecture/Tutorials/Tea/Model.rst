..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model:

===================
Model: a bag of tea
===================

We keep the model basic: Each tea can have a title, a description, and an optional image.

..  uml::

    class Tea {
        title
        ==
        description
        ==
        image
    }

The title and description are strings, the image is stored as a relation
to the model class :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Domain\Model\FileReference`, provided
by Extbase.


..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_database:

The database model
==================

Let us translate this into SQL and store the schema in a file called
:file:`ext_tables.sql`:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/ExtTablesSql.rst.txt

The image is stored as an integer. However the field :sql:`image` in the
database does not contains a reference to the image in form of an identifier.

The field :sql:`image` keeps track of the number of attached images. A separate table,
a so-called MM table, stores the actual relationship. Read about the definition
of this field here: :ref:`extbase_tutorial_tea_model_columns_image`.

..  hint::
    If you have had a look at a TYPO3 database before, you might wonder:
    What about all those special fields like :sql:`uid`, :sql:`pid`,
    :sql:`deleted`, etc? The answer is that TYPO3 will generate them automatically
    for you.

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_tca:

TCA - Table Configuration Array
===============================

The TCA tells TYPO3 about the database model. It defines all fields
containing data and all semantic fields that have a special meaning within
TYPO3 (like the :sql:`deleted` field which is used for soft deletion).

The TCA also defines how the corresponding input fields in the backend should look.

The TCA is a nested PHP array. In this example, we need the the following
keys on the first level:

:php:`ctrl`
    Settings for the complete table, such as a record title, a label
    for a single record, default sorting, and the names of some
    internal fields.

:php:`columns`
    Here we define all fields that can be used for user input in the
    backend.

:php:`types`
    We only have one type of tea record, however it is mandatory to
    describe at least one type. Here we define the order in which
    the fields are displayed in the backend.



..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_ctrl:

TCA :php:`ctrl` - Settings for the complete table
-------------------------------------------------

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Configuration/TCA/TeaCtrl.rst.txt

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_ctrl_title:

:php:`title`
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defines the title used when we are talking about the table in the backend.
It will be displayed on top of the list view of records in the backend
and in backend forms.

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/ExtensionArchitecture/Tutorials/Tea/TeaTitle.png
    :class: with-shadow

    The **title** of the :sql:`tea` table.

Strings starting with :php:`LLL:` will be replaced with localized text. See chapter
:ref:`Extension localization <extension_localization>`. All other strings
will be output as they are. This title will always be output as "Tea" without localization:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: EXT:tea/Configuration/TCA/tx_tea_domain_model_product_tea.php

   [
       'ctrl' => [
           'title' => 'Tea',
       ],
   ]

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_ctrl_label:

:php:`label`
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :php:`label` is used as name for a specific tea record. The name is used
in listings and in backend forms:


..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/ExtensionArchitecture/Tutorials/Tea/TeaLabel.png
    :class: with-shadow

    The **label** of a tea record.

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_ctrl_others:

:php:`tstamp`, :php:`deleted`, ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These fields are used to keep timestamp and status information for each record. You can read more about them in the `TCA Reference, chapter ctrl <t3tca:ctrl>`.

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_columns:

TCA :php:`columns` - Defining the fields
----------------------------------------

All fields that can be changed in the TYPO3 backend or used in the Extbase
model have to be listed here. Otherwise they will not be recognized by TYPO3.

The :sql:`title` field is defined like this:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Configuration/TCA/TeaColumnTitle.rst.txt

The title of the field is displayed above the input field. The type is a (string)
input field. The other configuration values influence display (size of the input
field) and or processing on saving ( :php:`'eval' => 'trim'` removes whitespace).

You can find a complete list of available input types and their propererties in
the :ref:`TCA Reference, chapter "Field types (config > type)" <t3tca:columns-types>`.

The other text fields are defined in a similar manner.

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_columns_image:

The :php:`image` field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the tea extension always supports two major TYPO3 versions it still uses
the deprecated way of creating an image field in TCA. If your extension only
has to support TYPO3 v12, you should use the field type :ref:`t3tca:columns-file`.

The image field is a special case, as it is created by a call to the API function
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::getFileFieldTCAConfig()`.
This method returns a preconfigured array, and saves you from writing a long and complicated configuration array.

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: EXT:tea/Configuration/TCA/tx_tea_domain_model_product_tea.php

    [
        'columns' => [
            'image' => [
                'label' => 'LLL:EXT:tea/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:tx_tea_domain_model_product_tea.image',
                'config' => \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::getFileFieldTCAConfig(
                    'image',
                    [
                        'maxitems' => 1,
                        'appearance' => [
                            'collapseAll' => true,
                            'useSortable' => false,
                            'enabledControls' => [
                                'hide' => false,
                            ],
                        ],
                    ]
                ),
            ],
        ],
    ];

..  tip::
    Do not worry about performance caused by the API call, the TCA files are
    cached in compiled form.

The array generated by the method
:php:`ExtensionManagementUtility::getFileFieldTCAConfig()` looks like this:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Configuration/TCA/TeaColumnImage.rst.txt

You are probably happy that this was generated for you and that you did not have to type it
yourself.

..  _extbase_tutorial_tea_model_types:

TCA :php:`types` - Configure the input form
-------------------------------------------

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Configuration/TCA/TeaTypes.rst.txt

The key :php:`showitem` lists all fields that should be displayed in the
backend input form, in the order they should be displayed.

..  hint::
    There are more sophisticated ways to influence how the fields are displayed:
    You can order them in tabs, put them into palettes etc. See
    :ref:`TCA reference, showitem <t3tca:types-properties-showitem>` for
    details.

Result - the complete TCA
--------------------------

Have a look at the complete file
`EXT:tea/Configuration/TCA/tx_tea_domain_model_product_tea.php <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/tea/blob/main/Configuration/TCA/tx_tea_domain_model_product_tea.php>`__.

Now the edit form for tea records will look like this:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/ExtensionArchitecture/Tutorials/Tea/TeaEditForm.png
    :class: with-shadow

    The complete input form for a tea record.

The list of teas in the module :guilabel:`Web -> List` looks like this:


..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/ExtensionArchitecture/Tutorials/Tea/TeaList.png
    :class: with-shadow

    A list of teas in the backend.

..  note::
    Up to this point we have only used TYPO3 Core features. You can create
    tables and backend forms exactly the same way without using Extbase.

The Extbase model
=================

It is a common practice — though not mandatory — to use PHP objects to store the
data while working on it.

The model is a more abstract representation of the database schema. It provides more advanced data types, way beyond what the database itself can offer. The model can also be used to define validators for the model properties
and to specify relationship types and rules (should relations be loaded
lazily? Should they be deleted if this object is deleted?).

Extbase models extend the
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\DomainObject\AbstractEntity` class.
The parent classes of this class already offer methods needed for persistence
to database, the identifier :php:`uid` etc.

.. include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Classes/Domain/Model/TeaProperties.rst.txt

..  attention::
    All properties of the model have to have the visibility keyword :php:`protected` or
    :php:`public`. :php:`private` properties are not supported, as properties have to
    be accessed by the repository and persistence and layers internally.

    If you want to prevent developers from extending you model, and
    accessing the properties of you model, you can make the class of the model
    final.

For all :php:`protected` properties we need at least a getter with the corresponding
name. If the property should be writable within Extbase, it must also
have a getter. Properties that are only set in backend forms do not
need a setter.

Example for the property :php:`title`:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Classes/Domain/Model/TeaTitle.rst.txt

The getter for the image also has to resolve the :ref:`lazy loading <extbase-annotation-lazy>`:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Tutorials/Tea/Classes/Domain/Model/TeaImage.rst.txt

See the complete
`class on Github: Tea <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/tea/blob/main/Classes/Domain/Model/Product/Tea.php>`__.
