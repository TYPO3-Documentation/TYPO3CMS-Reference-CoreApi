Configuration options
=====================

In the :file:`ext_conf_template.txt` file configuration options
for an extension can be defined. They will be accessible in the TYPO3 backend
from the Extension Manager.

There's a specific syntax to declare these options properly, which is
similar to the one used for TypoScript constants (see
:ref:`Declaring constants for the Constant editor <t3tsref:constant-editor>`).

This syntax applies to the comment
line that should be placed just before the constant. Consider the following
example (taken from system extension "rsaauth"):

.. code-block:: typoscript

   # cat=basic/enable; type=string; label=Path to the temporary directory:This directory will contain...
   temporaryDirectory =

First a category (cat) is defined ("basic") with the subcategory
"enable". Then a type is given ("string") and finally a label, which
is itself split (on the colon ":") into a title and a description
(this should actually be a localized string). The
above example will be rendered like this in the EM:

.. figure:: ../../Images/ExtensionConfigurationOptions.png
   :alt: Configuration screen for the rsaauth extension

The configuration tab displays all options from a single category. A
selector is available to switch between categories. Inside an option
screen, options are grouped by subcategory. At the bottom of the
screenshot, the label – split between header and description – is
visible. Then comes the field itself, in this case an input, because
the option's type is "string".

Once you saved the configuration in the ExtensionManager, it will be stored in
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['extConf']['your_extension_key']`
as a serialized array.

To fetch the value of :typoscript:`temporaryDirectory` from the example above,
you could simply use::

   $extensionConfiguration = unserialize($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['extConf']['your_extension_key']);
   $temporaryDirectory = $extensionConfiguration['temporaryDirectory'];

Or even better use the API to get the information merged with the default settings
if the settings have not been saved yet::

   /** @var \TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Utility\ConfigurationUtility $configurationUtility */
   $configurationUtility = $this->objectManager->get('TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Utility\ConfigurationUtility');
   $extensionConfiguration = $configurationUtility->getCurrentConfiguration('themes');

You can also define nested options using the TypoScript notation:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   directories {
      # cat=basic/enable; type=string; label=Path to the temporary directory
      tmp =
      # cat=basic/enable; type=string; label=Path to the cache directory
      cache =
   }

This will result in a multidimensional array::

   $extensionConfiguration = unserialize($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['extConf']['your_extension_key']);
   $extensionConfiguration['directories.']['tmp']
   $extensionConfiguration['directories.']['cache']

.. important::

   Notice the dot at the end of the :code:`directories` key.
   This notation must be used for every grouping key and
   is a convention of the TypoScript parser.
