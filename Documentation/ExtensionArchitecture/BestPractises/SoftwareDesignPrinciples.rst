Software Design Principles
==========================

The following principles are important to know when you plan to develop
extensions for TYPO3.

*   `Object-oriented programming (OOP) <https://phptherightway.com/#programming_paradigms>`__:
    describes how to encapsulate associated real-world aspects to abstract
    objects in a software.
*   `Domain-driven design (DDD) <https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php>`__: The goal of t
    his approach is to transcribe terms, rules, and actions of the problem
    at hand in an adequate way.
*   `Model-view-controller (MVC) <https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mvc-for-noobs--net-10488>`__:
    This programming paradigm leads to clear isolation of data, control of
    actions, and logic of interaction.
*   `Test-driven development (TDD) <https://phptherightway.com/#test_driven_development>`__:
    This approach is a basic technique for generating code that is stable,
    resilient to errors and legible - and therefore maintainable.
*   `Dependency Injection <https://phptherightway.com/#dependency_injection>`__:
    A software design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies
    and makes it possible to change them.
*   `Single-responsibility principle (SRP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle>`__:
    computer programming principle that states that "A module should be
    responsible to one, and only one, actor." The term actor refers to a group
    (consisting of one or more stakeholders or users) that requires a change
    in the module.

We also recommend to study common `software design
patterns <https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html>`__.
