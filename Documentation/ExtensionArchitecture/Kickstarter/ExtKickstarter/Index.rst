Extension Kickstarter
=====================

The Extension Kickstarter :composer:`stefanfroemken/ext-kickstarter` is a tool
that helps you to quickly create your own TYPO3 extensions. It provides a
basic framework and templates.

Where it makes a difference, you have the choice of working with or without
`Extbase <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:extbase>`_.

You can create a `plugin <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:plugins>`_
or a Controller with
(`Extbase Controller <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:extbase-controller>`_)
or without Extbase.

The extension can also help your to create an
`Upgrade wizard <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:upgrade-wizards>`_
or introduce `automatic testing <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:testing-extensions>`_.

The Extension Kickstarter can also be used to add functionality to existing
custom extensions.
