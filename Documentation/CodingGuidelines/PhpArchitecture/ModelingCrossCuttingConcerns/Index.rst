Modeling Cross Cutting Concerns
===============================

A cross cutting concern we are talking about here is a problem that
has to be solved at multiple, distinct places within the system that
have no further connection to each other. It is a cross class-hierarchy
and maybe cross-extension problem that can and should not be solved
with class abstractions.
