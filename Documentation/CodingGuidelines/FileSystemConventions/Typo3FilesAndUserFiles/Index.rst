TYPO3 files and user files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All files in the TYPO3 web site directory hierarchy are divided into
TYPO3 files and user files.

TYPO3 files are files that come with the TYPO3 source package released
by the TYPO3 association. This includes files inside the :code:`typo3/`
directory and the file named :code:`index.php` in the root of the TYPO3
installation.

All other files are user files. This for example includes extensions,
files in the :code:`fileadmin/` directory or files generated by TYPO3
(like configuration files, thumbnails or temporary CSS files). User
files are not allowed in the folder :code:`typo3/`.

These CGLs are valid for all TYPO3 files and for those user files,
which are to be generated or processed by the TYPO3 Core like for
example :code:`LocalConfiguration.php` or
:code:`AdditionalConfiguration.php`.
