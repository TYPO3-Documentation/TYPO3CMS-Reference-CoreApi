TypoScript Coding Guidelines
============================

Directory and File Names
========================

* As of TYPO3 8.7, the file ending can and should be :file:`.typoscript`.

* TypoScript files are located in the directory :file:`<extension>/Configuration/TypoScript`.

* File name for constants in static templates: :file:`constants.typoscript`.

* File name for TypoScript in static templates: :file:`setup.typoscript`.

More information about the file ending:

* TypoScript files used to have the ending :file:`.txt`.

* Since TYPO3 7, it is also possible to use the ending :file:`.ts`. This is
  not recommended because it is also used by TypeScript.

* Therefore, you should use :file:`.typoscript` if you are using TYPO3 8.7
  and later.

More Information
