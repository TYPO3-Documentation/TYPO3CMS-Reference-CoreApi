==================================
General Requirements for PHP Files
==================================

File Names
==========

The file name describes the functionality included in the file. It
consists of one or more nouns, written in UpperCamelCase. For example
in the :code:`frontend` system extension there is the file
:file:`ContentObject/ContentObjectRenderer.php`.

It is recommended to use only PHP classes and avoid non-class files.

Files that contain PHP interfaces must have the file name end on
"Interface", e.g. :file:`FileListEditIconHookInterface.php`.

One file can contain only one class or interface.

Extension for PHP files is always :code:`php`.


PHP Tags
========

Each PHP file in TYPO3 must use the full (as opposed to short) opening
PHP tag. There must be exactly one opening tag (no closing and opening
tags in the middle of the file). Example::

   <?php
   declare(strict_types = 1);
   // File content goes here

Closing PHP tags (e.g. at the end of the file) are not used.

Each newly introduced file **MUST** declare strict types for the given file.


Line Breaks
===========

TYPO3 uses Unix line endings (`\n`, PHP `chr(10)`). If
a developer uses Windows or Mac OS X platform, the editor must be
configured to use Unix line endings.


Line Length
===========

Very long lines of code should be avoided for questions of
readability. A line length of about 130 characters (**including**
spaces) is fine. Longer lines should be split into several lines whenever
possible. Each line fragment starting from the second must - compared
to the first one - be indented with four space characters more. Example::

    BackendUtility::viewOnClick(
        (int)$this->pageInfo['uid'],
        '',
        BackendUtility::BEgetRootLine((int)$this->pageInfo['uid'])
    );

Comment lines should be kept within a limit of about 80 characters
(**excluding** the leading spaces) as it makes them easier to read.

.. note::

    When splitting a line, try to split it at a point that makes as much
    sense as possible. In the above example, the line is split between two
    arguments and not in the middle of one. In case of long logical
    expressions, put the logical operator at the beginning of the next
    line, example:

    .. code-block:: php

        if ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['curlUse'] == '1'
            && preg_match('/^(?:http|ftp)s?|s(?:ftp|cp):/', $url)
        ) {


Whitespace and Indentation
==========================

TYPO3 uses space characters to indent source code. Following PSR-2,
one indentation level consists of four spaces.

There must be no white spaces in the end of a line. This can be done
manually or using a text editor that takes care of this.

Spaces must be added:

* On both sides of string, arithmetic, assignment and other similar
  operators (for example `.`, `=`, `+`, `-`,
  `?`, `:`, `*`, etc).

* After commas.

* In single line comments after the comment sign (double slash).

* After asterisks in multiline comments.

* After conditional keywords like `if (` and `switch (`.

* Before conditional keywords if the keyword is not the first
  character like `} elseif {`.

Spaces must not be present:

* After an opening brace and before a closing brace. For example:
  `explode( 'blah', 'someblah' )` needs to be written as `explode('blah', 'someblah')`.


Character Set
=============

All TYPO3 source files use the UTF-8 character set without byte order
mark (BOM). Encoding declarations like `declare(encoding = 'utf-8');`
must not be used. They might lead to problems, especially in
:file:`ext_tables.php` and :file:`ext_localconf.php` files of extensions, which are
merged internally in TYPO3 CMS. Files from third-party libraries may
have different encodings.
