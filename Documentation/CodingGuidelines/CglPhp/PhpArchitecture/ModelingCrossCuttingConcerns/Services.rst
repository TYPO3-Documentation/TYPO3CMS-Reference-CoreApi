Services
========


Characteristica
===============

* Services MUST be used as objects, they are never static

* A single service MUST consist of one class only

* Services MUST be located in a :file:`Service/` directory and MUST end
  with :code:`Service`, eg. :file:`Service/FoobarService.php`

* Service instances MAY hold state, but SHOULD be stateless

* Services MAY use configuration, but SHOULD not

* Services MAY have multiple entry points, but SHOULD have only one

* Services SHOULD NOT be singletons


Rationale
=========

A “service” in this context is meant as the relatively short-sighted
process of putting a class into a :file:`Service/` subfolder and calling
it a :code:`WhateverService`. It does not have too much to do with the
DDD Service context, which is broader. This section is just about which
scope can be expected for classes residing in a Service folder within
Core extensions.

From this point of view, services in TYPO3 world are a relatively slim
class construct that encapsulates a specific concern. It is too big for
a small static method, it may hold state, but it is still just a
relatively small scope. Each service consists typically of only a single
class. A bigger construct with interfaces, multiple sub classes is not
called a service anymore.

The above MAY and SHOULD mean that a single service MAY do a single one
or two of them, but if for instance a service is relatively big, has
many entry points, keeps state and depends on configuration, this is
too much and is a sign it should be modeled in a different and more
dedicated and more disjoint way.

The main risk with service classes is that they pile up to a
conglomeration of helper stuff classes that are hanging around without
good motivation. It is important that a service class should not be a
bin for something that just does not fit to a different better place
within the scope of a specific extension.


Good Examples
=============

* :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Service\CacheService`

  * Small and straight scope with useful helpers

  * It is a singleton, but that is feasible in this case


Bad Examples
============

* :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Service\AbstractService`,

  * Not modeled in a sane way, this should be within :file:`Core/Authentication`

  * Far too complex, class abstraction and extending classes
