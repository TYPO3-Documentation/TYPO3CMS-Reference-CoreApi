Extension directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An extension directory contains the following files and directories:


.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Name
         Name
   
   Description
         Description


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         ext\_emconf.php
   
   Description
         This is the only mandatory file in the extension. It describes
         extension to the rest of TYPO3.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         ext\_icon.gif
   
   Description
         This is icon of the extension. The name may not be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         ext\_localconf.php
   
   Description
         This file contains hook definitions and plugin configuration. The name
         may not be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         ext\_tables.php
   
   Description
         This file contains table declarations. For more information about
         table declarations and definitions see the “TYPO3 Core API” document.
         The name may not be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         ext\_tables.sql
   
   Description
         This files contains definitions for extension tables. The name may not
         be changed.
         
         The file may contain either a full table definition or a partial
         table. The full table definition declares extension's tables. It looks
         like a normal SQL CREATE TABLEstatement.
         
         The partial table definition contains a list of the fields that will
         be added to the existing table. Here is an example:
         
         ::
         
            CREATE TABLE pages (
                   tx_myext_field int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            );
         
         Notice the comma after the field. In the full table definition it will
         be a error but in the partial table definition it is required. TYPO3
         will merge this table definition to the existing table definition when
         comparing expected and actual table definitions. Partial definitions
         can also contain indexes and other directives. They can also change
         existing table fields though it is not recommended because it may
         create problems with the TYPO3 core and/or other extensions.
         
         TYPO3 parses ext\_tables.sqlfiles. TYPO3 expects that all table
         definitions in this file look like the ones produced by the
         mysqldumputility. Incorrect definitions may not be recognized by the
         TYPO3 SQL parser.


.. container:: table-row

This directory structure is  **strongly**  **recommended** .
Extensions may create their own directories (for example, move all
