    The PHP attribute :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Attribute\AsEventListener` has been
    introduced to tag a PHP class as an event listener. Alternatively, or if you
    need to be compatible with older TYPO3 versions, you can also register an
    event listener via the :file:`Configuration/Services.yaml` file. Switch to
    an older version of this page for an example or have a look at the section
    :ref:`EventDispatcherImplementation`.
