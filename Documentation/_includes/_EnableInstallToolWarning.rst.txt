    TYPO3 automatically
    deletes the :file:`ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL` file when you log out of the Install
    Tool or if the file is older than 60 minutes (expiry time).

    The file can be prevented from being deleted if it contains "KEEP_FILE" as
    content. In this case it will not be deleted automatically! Only use this
    feature during local development, for example in
    :ref:`DDEV <t3start:installation-ddev-tutorial>`!
