It helps to render this documentation on your own machine
"at home".

It is a good idea to check whether the *conf.py* file in this
*\_make* folder is still up to date. The latest version should
be maintained here:
https://github.com/marble/typo3-docs-typo3-org-resources/blob/master/userroot/scripts/bin/conf-2015-10.py
