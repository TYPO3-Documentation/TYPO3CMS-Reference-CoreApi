Running Unit tests
==================

..  _testing-unit-run-install:

Install PHPUnit and the TYPO3 testing framework
===============================================

In order to run unit tests within an extension or project you can require
PHPUnit and the testing framework via Composer as a development dependency:

..  code-block:: bash

    composer require --dev \
      "typo3/testing-framework":"^8.0.9" \
      "phpunit/phpunit":"^10.5"

Which versions to use depends on the PHP and TYPO3 versions to be supported.

The following matrix can help you to choose the correct versions.

================== ================ =================================== ==========
 testing-framework  TYPO3            PHP                                 PHPUnit
================== ================ =================================== ==========
 8.x.x              v12, v13 (main)  8.1, 8.2, 8.3 (8.4)                 ^10, ^11
 7.x.x              v11, v12         7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 (8.4)       ^9, ^10
 6.x.x              v10, v11         7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3   ^8, ^9
================== ================ =================================== ==========

Testing framework <= 6.x is no longer maintained.

..  _testing-unit-run-configure:

Provide configuration files for unit tests
==========================================

The TYPO3 testing framework comes with a predefined unit test configuration and
a bootstrapping file. You should copy these files into your project so you
can adjust them as needed:

Copy the files `vendor/typo3/testing-framework/Resources/Core/Build/UnitTests.xml
<https://github.com/TYPO3/testing-framework/blob/main/Resources/Core/Build/UnitTests.xml>`__
and `vendor/typo3/testing-framework/Resources/Core/Build/UnitTestsBootstrap.php
<https://github.com/TYPO3/testing-framework/blob/main/Resources/Core/Build/UnitTestsBootstrap.php>`__

Open file :file:`UnitTests.xml` and adjust the paths to the path (or multiple paths) where
the unit tests are stored. By convention many extensions store them in the
directory :path:`Tests/Unit` and subdirectories thereof:

..  code-block:: diff
    :caption: UnitTests.xml for extension testing

    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Unit tests">
    -        <directory>../../../../../../typo3/sysext/*/Tests/Unit/</directory>
    +        <directory>../../Tests/Unit/</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

If you are testing in a project you will probably have a directory from where
local extensions like site packages and client-specific extensions are installed
, so you can also include them:

..  code-block:: diff
    :caption: UnitTests.xml for project testing

    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Unit tests">
    -        <directory>../../../../../../typo3/sysext/*/Tests/Unit/</directory>
    +        <directory>../../Tests/Unit/</directory>
    +        <directory>../../packages/*/Tests/Unit/</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

Run the unit tests on your system or with DDEV
==============================================

If you have the required PHP version installed on your host system, you can run the
unit tests directly:

..  code-block:: bash

    php vendor/bin/phpunit -c Build/phpunit/UnitTests.xml

Or you can run them on ddev:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev exec php vendor/bin/phpunit -c Build/phpunit/UnitTests.xml

If you are using DDEV, you can also create a `custom command <https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/#custom-commands>`__
so you can run these tests again and again.

If you want to only run a specific test case (test class) or test (method in a
test class) you can use the filter option:

..  code-block:: bash

    php vendor/bin/phpunit -c Build/phpunit/UnitTests.xml --filter "MyTest"

You can of course define a
`Composer script <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md>` as well, so that
this command can be executed easily on the host, within a DDEV container and also in
GitHub Actions or Gitlab CI.

Run the unit tests with runTests.sh
===================================

If you are using a :file:`runTests.sh` like the one used by the :t3ext:`blog_example`
you can run the tests with:

..  code-block:: bash

    Build/Script/runTests.sh -s unit

It is also possible to choose the PHP version to run the tests with:

..  code-block:: bash

    Build/Script/runTests.sh -s unit -p 8.2

You can start by copying the
`runTests.sh of blog_example <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/blog_example/blob/main/Build/Scripts/runTests.sh>`__
and adjust it to your needs.

runTests.sh is a script that originates from the TYPO3 Core repository and is used as
a test and tool execution runner. It is based on running individual Docker containers
with several bash commands, and also allows Xdebug integration, different database
environments and much more. Once you copy such a file to your repository you need to
take care of maintaining it when possible bugfixes or changes occur upstream.
