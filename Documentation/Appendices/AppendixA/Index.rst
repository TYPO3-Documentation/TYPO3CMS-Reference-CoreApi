Appendix A: Historical perspective on RTE transformations
---------------------------------------------------------

The next sections describe in more details the necessity of RTE
transformations. The text was written at the birth of transformations
and might therefore be somewhat old-fashioned. However it checked out
generally OK and may help you to further understand why these issues
exist. The argumentation is still valid.
