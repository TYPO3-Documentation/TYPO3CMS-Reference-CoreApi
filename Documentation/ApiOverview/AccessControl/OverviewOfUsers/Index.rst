Backend users module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **SYSTEM > Backend users** module offers a convenient way
of working with backend users and groups. It provides a list of both
users and groups. The users list can be searched and filtered.

It also offers two additional, convenient features. The first
is the possibility to compare users. Just add users using the
"+ Compare" button and then hit the "Compare user list" button.
For example, this is the comparison of the three different editors
provided by the Introduction Package:

The other useful feature is the ability to switch user,
by clicking on the "Switch to user" action icon:

You will then be logged in as that user (note how the user name
is prefixed with "SU" for "Simulate User"). To "switch back",
just use the "Exit" button (which replaces the usual "Logout"
button).
