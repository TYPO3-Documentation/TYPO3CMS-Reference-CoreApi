===========
Service API
===========

All service classes must inherit from the base service class
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Service\AbstractService`,
unless the service type provides a specific
base class (authentication services, for example, inherit from
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Authentication\AbstractAuthenticationService` instead).
These specific classes should
normally themselves extend :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Service\AbstractService`.
This class provides a large number of important or useful methods which are
described below, grouped by type of usage.


.. _services-developer-service-api-implementation:


Service Implementation
======================

These methods are related to the general functioning of services.

.. important::

   :php:`init()` and :php:`reset()` are the most important methods to implement
   when developing your own services.

init
  This method is expected to perform any necessary initialization for
  the service. Its return value is critical. It should return :php:`false` if
  the service is not available for whatever reason. Otherwise it should
  return :php:`true`.

  Note that's it's not necessary to check for OS compatibility, as this
  will already have been done by
  :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addService()`
  when the service is registered.

  Executables should be checked, though, if any.

  The :php:`init()` method is automatically called by
  :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstanceService()`
  when requesting a service.

reset
  When a service is requested by a call to
  :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstanceService()`,
  the generated instance of the service class is kept in a registry
  (:php:`$GLOBALS['T3_VAR']['makeInstanceService']`). When the same
  service is requested again during the same code run, a new instance is
  **not** created. Instead the stored instance is returned. At that
  point the :php:`reset()` method is called.

  This method can be used to clean up data that may have been set during
  the previous use of that instance.


\_\_destruct
  Clean up method. The base implementation calls on
  :php:`unlinkTempFiles()` to delete all temporary files.


The little schema below summarizes the process of getting a service
instance and when each of :php:`init()` and :php:`reset()` are
called.

.. _services-developer-service-api-getters:

Getter Methods for Service Information
======================================

Most of the below methods are quite obvious, except for
:php:`getServiceOption()`.

getServiceInfo
  Returns the array containing the service's properties

getServiceKey
  Returns the service's key

getServiceTitle
  Returns the service's title

getServiceOption
  This method is used to retrieve the value of a service option, as
  defined in the :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SVCONF']` array. It will
  take into account possible default values as described in the
  :ref:`Service configuration chapter <services-configuration-service-configuration>`.

  This method requires more explanation.
  Imagine your service has an option called "ignoreBozo". To retrieve it
  in a proper way, you should not access
  :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SVCONF']` directly, but use
  :php:`getServiceOption()` instead. In its simplest form, it will look
  like this (inside your service's code)::

     $ignoreBozo = $this->getServiceOption('ignoreBozo');

  This will retrieve the value of the "ignoreBozo" option for your
  specific service, if defined. If not, it will try to find a value in
  the default configuration. Additional call parameters can be added:

  - the second parameter is a default value to be used if no value was
    found at all (including in the default configuration)

  - the third parameter can be used to temporarily switch off the usage of
    the default configuration.

  This allows for a lot of flexibility.


.. _services-developer-service-api-error:

Error Handling
==============

This set of methods handles the error reporting and manages the error
queue. The error queue works as a stack. New errors are added on top
of the previous ones. When an error is read from the queue it is the
last one in that is taken (last in, first out). An error is actually a
short array comprised of an error number and an error message.

The error queue exists only at run-time. It is not stored into session
or any other form of persistence.

errorPush
  Puts a new error on top of the queue stack.

errorPull
  Removes the latest (topmost) error in the queue stack.

getLastError
  Returns the error number from the latest error in the queue, or true
  if queue is empty.

getLastErrorMsg
  Same as above, but returns the error message.

getErrorMsgArray
  Returns an array with the error messages of all errors in the queue.

getLastErrorArray
  Returns the latest error as an array (number and message).

resetErrors
  Empties the error queue.


.. _services-developer-service-api-general:

General Service Functions
=========================

checkExec
  This method checks the availability of one or more executables on the
  server. A comma-separated list of executable names is provided as a
  parameter. The method returns :php:`true` if **all** executables are
  available.

  The method relies on :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\CommandUtility::checkCommand()`
  to find the executables, so it will search through the paths defined/allowed by
  the TYPO3 CMS configuration.

deactivateService
  Internal method to temporarily deactivate a service at run-time, if it
  suddenly fails for some reason.


.. _services-developer-service-api-io-tools:

I/O Tools
=========

A lot of early services were designed to handle files, like those used
by the DAM. Hence the base service class provides a number of methods
to simplify the service developer's life when it comes to read and
write files. In particular it provides an easy way of creating and
cleaning up temporary files.

checkInputFile
  Checks if a file exists and is readable within the paths allowed by
  the TYPO3 CMS configuration.

readFile
  Reads the content of a file and returns it as a string. Calls on
  :php:`checkInputFile()` first.

writeFile
  Writes a string to a file, if writable and within allowed paths. If no
  file name is provided, the data is written to a temporary file, as
  created by :php:`tempFile()` below. The file path is returned.

tempFile
  Creates a temporary file and keeps its name in an internal registry of
  temp files.

registerTempFile
  Adds a given file name to the registry of temporary files.

unlinkTempFiles
  Deletes all the registered temporary files.


.. _services-developer-service-api-io-input-output:

I/O Input and I/O Output
========================

These methods provide a standard way of defining or getting the
content that needs to be processed – if this is the kind of operation
that the service provides – and the processed output after that.

setInput
  Sets the content (and optionally the type of content) to be processed.

setInputFile
  Sets the input file from which to get the content (and optionally the
  type).

getInput
  Gets the input to process. If the content is currently empty, tries to
  read it from the input file.

getInputFile
  Gets the name of the input file, after putting it through
  :php:`checkInputFile()` . If no file is defined, but some content is,
  the method writes the content to a temporary file and returns the path
  to that file.

setOutputFile
  Sets the output file name.

getOutput
  Gets the output content. If an output file name is defined, the
  content is gotten from that file.

getOutputFile
  Gets the name of the output file. If such file is not defined, a
  temporary file is created with the output content and that file's path
  is returned.
