=====================
Service configuration
=====================

Some services will not need additional configuration. Others may have
some options that can be set in the Extension Manager. Yet others may
be configured via local configuration files (:file:`ext_localconf.php` ).
Example:

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SVCONF']['auth']['tx_example_sv1']['foo'] = 'bar';

The general syntax is:

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SVCONF'][service type][service key][config key] = value;

A configuration can also be set for all services belonging to the same
service type by using the keyword "default" instead of a service key:

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SVCONF'][service type]['default'][config key] = value;

The available configuration settings should be described in the
service's documentation. See :ref:`Service API <services-developer-service-api>`
to see how you can read these values properly inside your service.
