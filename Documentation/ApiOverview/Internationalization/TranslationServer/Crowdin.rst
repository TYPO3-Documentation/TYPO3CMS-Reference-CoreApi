=========================
Localization with Crowdin
=========================

.. tip::

   Crowdin is used for TYPO3 10 by default. Since 9.5.14 it can be enabled for TYPO3 9 by using a :ref:`feature toggle <xliff-translating-featuretoggle>`.

What is Crowdin
===============

Crowdin is a localization management platform and offers the core features essential for delivering great translation:

- **Single source**: Translate text once that is used in different versions and parts of the software.
- **Machine translation**: Let machines do the first pass and then human-translators can edit the suggestions.
- **Glossary**: we can use our own TYPO3 glossary to make sure specific words are properly translated (e.g. Template in german, TypoScript or SEO)
- **Translation memory**: we can reuse existing translations, no matter if done for the TYPO3 Core or an extension.
- **Crowdin** is a cloud-based content localization solution.


.. _crowdin-initiative:
