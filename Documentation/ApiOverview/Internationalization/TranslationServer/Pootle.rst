Localization with Pootle
=========================

.. important::

   Pootle has been superseded by the usage of Crowdin which is described in
   detail at :ref:`xliff-translating-server-crowdin`.

To manage translations of extensions uploaded to the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER),
the TYPO3 community runs an `official translation server <https://translation.typo3.org/>`_,
based on `Pootle <https://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`__. Localization files of TER extensions
in English are uploaded on that server and translations are packaged nightly.
They can be fetched in the TYPO3 backend, via the Install Tool and on the command line.
