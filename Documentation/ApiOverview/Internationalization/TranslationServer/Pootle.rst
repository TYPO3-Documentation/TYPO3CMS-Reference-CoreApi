Localization with Pootle
=========================

.. important::

   Pootle has been superseded by the usage of Crowdin which is described in detail at :ref:`xliff-translating-server-crowdin`.

To manage translations of extensions uploaded to the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER),
the TYPO3 community runs an `official translation server <https://translation.typo3.org/>`_,
based on `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`__. Localization files of TER extensions
in English are uploaded on that server and translations are packaged nightly.
They can be fetched in the TYPO3 CMS backend, via the Install Tool and on the command line.

It is not the point of this manual to go into the details of the translation
process. More information can be found in the `TYPO3 wiki <http://wiki.typo3.org/Translation>`_.
