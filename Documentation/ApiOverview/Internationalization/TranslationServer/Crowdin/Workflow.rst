Workflow
========

The following workflow is used to bring a translation into a TYPO3 installation.

.. rst-class:: bignums

1. English Sources

   The sources in English are maintained in the project itself.

2. Creating translations on Crowdin.com

   The translations are managed on Crowdin at https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-cms.

   You can either translate all strings on the Crowdin platform or directly in the TYPO3 backend.

   .. todo:: Add link to usage

3. Crowdin Bridge

   A separate project is accountable for exporting the translations from Crowdin.
   This consists of several steps:

   - Trigger a build of all projects
   - Download all translations including multiple branches and all available languages
   - Create zip files of all single xlf files
   - Copy the files to the translation server

   .. todo:: Link to the project

4. Import translations into TYPO3 installations

   The translations can be downloaded within a TYPO3 installation.
   This is described at :ref:`xliff-translating-fetch`.
