.. php:class:: LanguageService

   Main API to fetch labels from XLF (label files) based on the current system
   language of TYPO3. It is able to resolve references to files + their pointers to the
   proper language. If you see something about "LLL", this class does the trick for you. It
   is not related for language handling of content, but rather of labels for plugins.

   Usually this is injected into $GLOBALS['LANG'] when in backend or CLI context, and
   populated by the current backend user. Don't rely on $GLOBAL['LANG'] in frontend, as it is only
   available in certain circumstances!
   In Frontend, this is also used to translate "labels", see TypoScriptFrontendController->sL()
   for that.

   As TYPO3 internally does not match the proper ISO locale standard, the "locale" here
   is actually a list of supported language keys, (see Locales class), whereas "english"
   has the language key "default".

   .. php:attr:: lang

      This is set to the language that is currently running for the user


   .. php:attr:: debugKey

      If TRUE, will show the key/location of labels in the backend.


   .. php:method:: getLL(string $index)

      Returns the label with key $index from the globally loaded $LOCAL_LANG array.

      Mostly used from modules with only one LOCAL_LANG file loaded into the global space.

      :param string $index: Label key

   .. php:method:: sL(string $input)

      Main and most often used method.

      Resolve strings like these:
      'LLL:EXT:core/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_core.xlf:labels.depth_0'
      This looks up the given .xlf file path in the 'core' extension for label 'labels.depth_0'

      :param string $input: Label key/reference
      :returntype: string

   .. php:method:: includeLLFile(string $fileRef)

      Includes locallang file (and possibly additional localized version if configured for)
      Read language labels will be merged with $LOCAL_LANG (if $setGlobal = TRUE).

      :param string $fileRef: $fileRef is a file-reference
