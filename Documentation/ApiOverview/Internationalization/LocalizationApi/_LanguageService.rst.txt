.. php:class:: LanguageService

   Main API to fetch labels from XLF (label files) based on the current system
   language of TYPO3. It is able to resolve references to files + their pointers to the
   proper language. If you see something about "LLL", this class does the trick for you. It
   is not related for language handling of content, but rather of labels for plugins.
   
   Usually this is injected into $GLOBALS['LANG'] when in backend or CLI context, and
   populated by the current backend user. Don't rely on $GLOBAL['LANG'] in frontend, as it is only
   available in certain circumstances!
   In Frontend, this is also used to translate "labels", see TypoScriptFrontendController->sL()
   for that.
   
   As TYPO3 internally does not match the proper ISO locale standard, the "locale" here
   is actually a list of supported language keys, (see Locales class), whereas "english"
   has the language key "default".

   .. php:attr:: lang
   
      This is set to the language that is currently running for the user
      
      
   .. php:attr:: debugKey
   
      If TRUE, will show the key/location of labels in the backend.
      
      
   .. php:method:: getLL(string $index)
   
      Returns the label with key $index from the globally loaded $LOCAL_LANG array.
      
      Mostly used from modules with only one LOCAL_LANG file loaded into the global space.
      
      :param string $index: Label key
      
   .. php:method:: sL(string $input)
   
      splitLabel function
      
      All translations are based on $LOCAL_LANG variables.
      'language-splitted' labels can therefore refer to a local-lang file + index.
      Refer to 'Inside TYPO3' for more details
      
      :param string $input: Label key/reference
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: includeLLFile(string $fileRef)
   
      Includes locallang file (and possibly additional localized version if configured for)
      Read language labels will be merged with $LOCAL_LANG (if $setGlobal = TRUE).
      
      :param string $fileRef: $fileRef is a file-reference
      
   .. php:method:: create(string $locale)
   
      Factory method to create a language service object.
      
      :param string $locale: the locale (= the TYPO3-internal locale given)
      :returntype: self
      
   .. php:method:: createFromUserPreferences(TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Authentication\\AbstractUserAuthentication $user)
   
      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Authentication\\AbstractUserAuthentication $user: the user
      :returntype: self
      
   .. php:method:: createFromSiteLanguage(TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Site\\Entity\\SiteLanguage $language)
   
      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Site\\Entity\\SiteLanguage $language: the language
      :returntype: self
