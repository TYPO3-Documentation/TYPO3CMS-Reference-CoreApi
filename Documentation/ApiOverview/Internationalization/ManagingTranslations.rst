Managing translations for backend
=================================

This sections highlights the different ways to translate and manage XLIFF files.


.. index:: Internationalization; Fetch translations
.. _xliff-translating-fetch:

Fetching translations
=====================

The interface of the Install Tool in :guilabel:`ADMIN TOOLS > Maintenance > Manage language packs`
allows to manage the list of available languages to your users and can fetch and
update language packs of TER and Core extensions from the official translation server.
The module is rather straight forward to use and should be pretty much self explanatory.
Downloaded language packs are stored in :ref:`Environment-labels-path`.

   The Languages module with some active languages and status of extensions language packs


Language packs can also be fetched using the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

   /path/to/typo3/bin/typo3 language:update


.. index:: Internationalization; Local translations
.. _xliff-translating-local:

Local translations
==================

Using `Virtaal <http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/index>`_,
it is possible to translate XLIFF files locally.
Virtaal is an open source, cross-platform application.

   Translating with Virtaal, with suggestions from other software

Translating files locally is useful for extensions which are not meant to be
published or for creating :ref:`custom translations <xliff-translating-custom>`.


.. index:: Internationalization; Custom translations
.. _xliff-translating-custom:

Custom translations
===================

The :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']` allows to
override both locallang-XML and XLIFF files. Actually this is not just about translations.
Default language files can also be overridden. In the case of XLIFF files, the
syntax is as follows (to be placed in an extension's :file:`ext_localconf.php` file):

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['EXT:frontend/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_tca.xlf'][] = 'EXT:examples/Resources/Private/Language/custom.xlf';
   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['de']['EXT:news/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_modadministration.xlf'][] = 'EXT:examples/Resources/Private/Language/Overrides/de.locallang_modadministration.xlf';


The first line shows how to override a file in the default language,
the second how to override a German ("de") translation. The German language file
looks like this:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
   <xliff version="1.0">
      <file source-language="en" datatype="plaintext" date="2013-03-09T18:44:59Z" product-name="examples">
         <header/>
         <body>
            <trans-unit id="pages.title_formlabel" xml:space="preserve">
               <source>Most important tile</source>
               <target>Wichtigster Titel</target>
            </trans-unit>
         </body>
      </file>
   </xliff>


and the result can be easily seen in the backend:

   Custom translation in the TYPO3 backend


.. important::

   - Please note that you do not have to copy the full reference file, but only the labels you want to translate.

   - The path to the file to override must be expressed as :file:`EXT:foo/bar/...`. For the
     extension "xlf" or "xml" can be used interchangeably. The TYPO3 Core will try both anyway,
     but using "xlf" is more correct and future-proof.

.. attention::

   The following is a **bug** but must be taken as a constraint for now:

   - The files containing the custom labels must be located inside an extension. Other locations
     will not be considered.

   - The original translation needs to exist in :ref:`Environment-labels-path` or next to the base
     translation file in extensions, for example in :file:`typo3conf/ext/myext/Resources/Private/Language/`.


.. index:: Internationalization; Custom languages
.. _xliff-translating-languages:

Custom languages
================

:ref:`i18n_languages` describes the languages which are supported by default.

It is possible to add custom languages to the TYPO3 backend and create the translations
locally using XLIFF files.

First of all, the language must be declared:

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['localization']['locales']['user'] = array(
       'gsw_CH' => 'Swiss German',
   );

This new language does not need to be entirely translated. It can be defined
as falling back to another language, so that only differing labels need be
translated:

.. code-block:: php

  $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['localization']['locales']['dependencies'] = array(
     'gsw_CH' => array('de_AT', 'de'),
  );

In this case we define that "gsw_CH" (which is the `official code <http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/>`_ for
"Schwiizert端端tsch" - that is, "Swiss German") can fall back on "de_AT" (another custom translation) and then on "de".

The translations have to be stored in the appropriate labels path sub folder
(:ref:`Environment-labels-path`), in this case :file:`/gsw_CH`.

The very least you need is to translate the label containing the name of the
language itself, so that it appears in the user preferences. In our example this
would be in file :file:`/gsw_CH/setup/mod/gsw_CH.locallang.xlf`.

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
   <xliff version="1.0">
      <file source-language="en" target-language="gsw_CH" datatype="plaintext">
         <header/>
         <body>
            <trans-unit id="lang_gsw_CH" approved="yes">
               <source>Swiss German</source>
               <target state="translated">Schwiizert端端tsch</target>
            </trans-unit>
         </body>
      </file>
   </xliff>

.. figure:: ../../Images/InternationalizationXliffCustomLanguage.png
   :alt: User Settings screenshot

   The new language appears in the user preferences

.. note::

   Any language will always fall back on the default one (i.e. English) when
   a translation is not found. A custom language will fall back on its "parent"
   language automatically. Thus - in our second example of de_AT (German for Austria) - no fallback would have to be
   defined for "de_AT" if it were just falling back on "de".

   Configure :yaml:`typo3Language` for using custom languages in the frontend,
   see :ref:`sitehandling-addinglanguages` for details.
