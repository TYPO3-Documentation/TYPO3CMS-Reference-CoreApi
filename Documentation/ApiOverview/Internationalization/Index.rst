Internationalization
====================

Internationalization is achieved in TYPO3 with the use of files containing
localizable strings. Since TYPO3 CMS 4.6, the XLIFF format is used. It is
described further in this section. Until TYPO3 CMS 4.5, a proprietary format
called ":ref:`locallang XML <locallang>`" was used.
