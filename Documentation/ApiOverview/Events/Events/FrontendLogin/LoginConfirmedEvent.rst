===================
LoginConfirmedEvent
===================

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\FrontendLogin\Event\LoginConfirmedEvent` is
triggered when a login was successful.

..  versionchanged:: 14.0
    This event is now correctly dispatched, when a
    logout redirect is configured. Previously the now removed `actionUri` was used as target 
    for the logout form action, in which case the `LogoutConfirmedEvent` was not triggered on logout.
