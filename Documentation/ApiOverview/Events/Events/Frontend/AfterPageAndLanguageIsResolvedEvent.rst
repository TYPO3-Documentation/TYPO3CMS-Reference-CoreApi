===================================
AfterPageAndLanguageIsResolvedEvent
===================================

..  versionadded:: 12.0
    This PSR-14 event replaces the following hooks:

    *   :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_fe.php']['determineId-PostProc']`
    *   :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_fe.php']['settingLanguage_postProcess']`

The event fires in the frontend process after a given page has been resolved
including its language.

This event modifies TYPO3's language resolution logic
through custom additions. It also allows sending a custom response via event
listeners (e.g. a custom 403 response).

..  note::
    There are three events in the process when the main
    :php:`TypoScriptFrontendController` class resolves a page and its rootline
    based on the incoming request. They are triggered in the following order:

    *   :ref:`BeforePageIsResolvedEvent`
    *   :ref:`AfterPageWithRootLineIsResolvedEvent`
    *   AfterPageAndLanguageIsResolvedEvent
