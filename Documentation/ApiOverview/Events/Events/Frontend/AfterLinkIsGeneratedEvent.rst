=========================
AfterLinkIsGeneratedEvent
=========================

..  note::
    It is recommended to use the PSR-14 event instead of the global
    getATagParams hook (:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_content.php']['getATagParamsPostProc']`)
    to add additional attributes (see example below) to links.

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Event\AfterLinkIsGeneratedEvent`
allows PHP developers to modify any kind of link generated by TYPO3's mighty
:php:`typolink()` functionality.

By using this event, it is possible to add attributes to links to
internal pages, or links to files, as the event contains the actual information
of the link type with it.

As this event works with the :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Typolink\LinkResultInterface`
object it is possible to modify or replace the LinkResult information instead of
working with string replacement functionality for adding, changing or removing
attributes.

If a link could not be generated, a
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Typolink\UnableToLinkException`  might be thrown.
