AfterCachedPageIsPersistedEvent
===============================

.. versionadded:: 12.0

   This event together with :ref:`AfterCacheableContentIsGeneratedEvent` has
   been introduced to serve as a direct replacement for the removed hook:

   * :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_fe.php']['insertPageIncache']`

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Event\AfterCachedPageIsPersistedEvent`
is commonly used to generate a static file cache. This event is only called if
the page was actually stored in TYPO3's page cache.
