BeforePageIsResolvedEvent
=========================

..  versionadded:: 12.0
    This PSR-14 event replaces the
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_fe.php']['determineId-PreProcessing']`
    hook.

..  versionchanged:: 13.0
    The event no longer receives an instance of
    :php:`TypoScriptFrontendController`, the :php:`getController()` method has
    been removed: The controller is instantiated *after* the event has been
    dispatched, event listeners can no longer work with this object.

    Instead, the event now contains an instance of the new
    :abbr:`DTO (Data Transfer Object)`
    :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Page\PageInformation`, which can be retrieved
    and manipulated by event listeners, if necessary.

    See :ref:`BeforePageIsResolvedEvent-migration`.

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Event\BeforePageIsResolvedEvent` is
fired before the frontend process is trying to fully resolve a given page by its
page ID and the request.

The events may not be dispatched anymore when the
:ref:`middleware <request-handling>`
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Middleware\TypoScriptFrontendInitialization`
creates early responses.

..  tip::
    There are three events in the process around the resolving of a page
    and its root line or language based on the incoming request. They are
    triggered in the following order:

    #.  BeforePageIsResolvedEvent
    #.  :ref:`AfterPageWithRootLineIsResolvedEvent`
    #.  :ref:`AfterPageAndLanguageIsResolvedEvent`

Migration
=========

Use the method :php:`getPageInformation()` to retrieve the calculated page state
at this point in the frontend rendering chain. Event listeners that manipulate
that object should set it again within the event using
:php:`setPageInformation()`.

In case the middleware :php:`TypoScriptFrontendInitialization` no longer
dispatches an event when it created an early response on its own, a custom
middleware can be added around that middleware to retrieve and further
manipulate a response if needed.
