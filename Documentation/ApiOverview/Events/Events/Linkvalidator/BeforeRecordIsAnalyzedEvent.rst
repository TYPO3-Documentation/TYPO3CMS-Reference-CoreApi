===========================
BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent
===========================

Event that is fired to modify results (= add results) or modify the record before the linkanalyzer analyzes
the record.

Example
=======

In this example we are checking if there are external links containing the URL
of the project itself as editors tend to set external links on internal pages
at times.

The following code can be put in a custom
:ref:`minimal extension <extension-minimal>`. You find a live example in
our example extension
`EXT:examples <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3docs-examples>`__.

Create a class that works as event listener. This class does not implement or
extend any class. It has to provide a method that accepts an event of type
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Linkvalidator\Event\BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent`.  By default
the method is called :php:`__invoke`:

.. include:: /CodeSnippets/Events/Linkvalidator/BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent/ExampleInvoke.rst.txt

The listener must then be registered in the extensions :php:`Services.yaml`:

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: EXT:examples/Configuration/Services.yaml

    services:
       _defaults:
          autowire: true
          autoconfigure: true
          public: false

       T3docs\Examples\:
          resource: '../Classes/*'
          exclude: '../Classes/Domain/Model/*'

       T3docs\Examples\EventListener\LinkValidator\CheckExternalLinksToLocalPagesEventListener:
          tags:
             - name: event.listener
               identifier: 'txExampleCheckExternalLinksToLocalPages'

For the implementation we need the :php:`BrokenLinkRepository` to register
additional link errors and the :php:`SoftReferenceParserFactory` so we can
automatically parse for links. These two classes have to be injected via
:ref:`dependency injection <Dependency-Injection>`:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Events/Linkvalidator/BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent/ExampleInject.rst.txt

Now we use the :php:`SoftReferenceParserFactory` to find all registered link
parsers for soft reference. Then we apply each of these parsers in turn to
the configured field in the current record. For each link found we can now
match if it is an external link to an internal page.

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Events/Linkvalidator/BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent/ParseFields.rst.txt

If the URL found in the matching is external and contains the local domain name
we add the an entry to the :php:`BrokenLinkRepository` and to the result set of
:php:`BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent`.

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Events/Linkvalidator/BeforeRecordIsAnalyzedEvent/AddToBrokenLinkRepository.rst.txt

The :php:`BrokenLinkRepository` is not an Extbase repository but a repository
based on the :ref:`Doctrine database abstraction (DBAL) <Database_Introduction>`.
It therefore expects an array with the names of the table fields as argument and
not an Extbase model. The method internally uses
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\Connection::insert`. This method automatically
quotes all identifiers and values, we therefore do not worry about escaping here.

..  tip::
    It is recommended to always use a unique error number. An easy way to ensure
    the error number to be unique is to use the current Unix timestamp of the
    time of writing the code.
