    The event also provides the current PSR-7 :php:`\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface`
    for additional context

The PSR-14 event
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\Event\PolicyMutatedEvent`
will be dispatched once all mutations have been applied to the current
:ref:`Content Security Policy <content-security-policy>` object, just before the
corresponding HTTP header is added to the HTTP response object. This allows
individual adjustments for custom implementations.
