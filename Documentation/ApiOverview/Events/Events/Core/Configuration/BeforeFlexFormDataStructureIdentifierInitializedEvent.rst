=====================================================
BeforeFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent
=====================================================

..  versionadded:: 12.0
    This event was introduced to replace and improve the method
    :php:`getDataStructureIdentifierPreProcess()` of the hook
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['workspaces']['modifyDifferenceArray']`.

The PSR-14 event
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Configuration\Event\BeforeFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent`
can be used to control the :ref:`FlexForm <flexforms>` parsing in an
object-oriented approach.

Migration
=========

Using the removed hook method :php:`getDataStructureIdentifierPreProcess()` of
the hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['workspaces']['modifyDifferenceArray']`
previously required implementations to always return an :php:`array`.

This means, implementations returned an empty :php:`array` in case they did
not want to set an identifier, allowing further implementations to be
called.

This behaviour has now changed. As soon as a listener sets the identifier
using the :php:`setIdentifier()` method, the event propagation is stopped
immediately and no further listeners are being called. Therefore, listeners
should avoid setting an empty :php:`array` but should just "return" without
any change to the :php:`$event` object in such a case.
