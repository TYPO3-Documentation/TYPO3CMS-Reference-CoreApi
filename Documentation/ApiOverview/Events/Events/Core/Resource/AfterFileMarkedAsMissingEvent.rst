=============================
AfterFileMarkedAsMissingEvent
=============================

The PSR-14 event
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Event\AfterFileMarkedAsMissingEvent`
is fired once a file was just marked as missing in the database
(table :sql:`sys_file`).

*Example*: If a file is marked as missing, listeners can try to recover a file.
This can happen on specific setups where editors also work via FTP.
