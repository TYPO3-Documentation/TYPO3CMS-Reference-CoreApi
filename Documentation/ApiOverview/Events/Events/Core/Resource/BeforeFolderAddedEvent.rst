======================
BeforeFolderAddedEvent
======================

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Event\BeforeFolderAddedEvent` is
fired before a folder is about to be added to the resource
:ref:`storage <fal-architecture-components-storage>` /
:ref:`driver <fal-architecture-components-drivers>`.
This allows to further specify folder names according to regulations for a
specific project.
