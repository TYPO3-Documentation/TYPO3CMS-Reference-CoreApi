=====================
AfterFolderAddedEvent
=====================

The PSR-14 event
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Event\AfterFolderAddedEvent`
is fired after a folder was added to the resource
:ref:`storage <fal-architecture-components-storage>` /
:ref:`driver <fal-architecture-components-drivers>`.

This allows to customize permissions or set up editor permissions automatically
via listeners.
