EnrichFileMetaDataEvent
=======================

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Event\EnrichFileMetaDataEvent`
is called after a record has been loaded from database. It allows other places
to perform the extension of metadata at runtime or, for example, translation
and workspace overlay.
