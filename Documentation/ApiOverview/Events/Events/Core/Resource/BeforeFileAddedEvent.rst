====================
BeforeFileAddedEvent
====================

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Event\BeforeFileAddedEvent`
is fired before a file is about to be added to the resource
:ref:`storage <fal-architecture-components-storage>` /
:ref:`driver <fal-architecture-components-drivers>`.
This allows to perform custom checks to a file or restrict access to a file
before the file is added.
