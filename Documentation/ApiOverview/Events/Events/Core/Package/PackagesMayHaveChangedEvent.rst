===========================
PackagesMayHaveChangedEvent
===========================

..  versionadded:: 10.3
    The event was introduced to replace the Signal/Slot
    `\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Package\PackageManager::packagesMayHaveChanged`.

The PSR-14 event :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Package\Event\PackagesMayHaveChangedEvent`
is a marker event to ensure that Core is re-triggering the package ordering and
package listings.

..  attention::
    This event is dispatched when an extension is changed in the
    :guilabel:`Extension Manager`, therefore starting with TYPO3 v11 this
    event is only dispatched in legacy installations, not in Composer-based
    installations. Use
    `installer events by Composer <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#installer-events>`__
    for Composer-based installations.
