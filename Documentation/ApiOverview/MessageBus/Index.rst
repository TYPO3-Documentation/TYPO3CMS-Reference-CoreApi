===========
Message bus
===========

..  versionadded:: 12.2

TYPO3 provides a message bus solution based on `symfony/messenger`_. It has the
ability to send messages and then handle them immediately (synchronous) or
send them through transports (asynchronous, for example, queues) to be handled
later.

For backwards compatibility, the default implementation uses the synchronous
transport. This means that the message bus will behave exactly as before, but it
will be possible to switch to a different (asynchronous) transport on a
per-project base.

To offer asynchronicity, TYPO3 also provides a transport implementation based on
the `Doctrine DBAL messenger transport`_ from Symfony and a basic implementation
of a consumer command.

"Everyday" usage - as a developer
=================================

Dispatch a message
------------------

..  rst-class:: bignums

#.  Add a PHP class for your message object (which is an arbitrary PHP class)

    ..  literalinclude:: _DemoMessage.php
        :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Queue/Message/DemoMessage.php

#.  Inject the :php:`MessageBusInterface` into your class and call the
    :php:`dispatch()` method

    ..  literalinclude:: _MyClass.php
        :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/MyClass.php


Register a handler
------------------

..  rst-class:: bignums

#.  Implement the handler class

    ..  literalinclude:: _DemoHandler.php
        :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Queue/Handler/DemoHandler.php

#.  Register the handler

    Use a tag to register a handler. Use :yaml:`before`/:yaml:`after` to define
    an order.

    ..  literalinclude:: _demo-handler.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml

..  _message-bus-routing:

"Everyday" usage - as a system administrator/integrator
=======================================================

By default, TYPO3 will behave like in versions before TYPO3 v12. This means that
the message bus will use the synchronous transport and all messages will be
handled immediately. To benefit from the message bus, it is recommended to
switch to an asynchronous transport. Using asynchronous transports increases the
resilience of the system by decoupling external dependencies even further.

Currently, the TYPO3 Core provides an asynchronous transport based on the
`Doctrine DBAL messenger transport`_. This transport is configured to use the
default TYPO3 database connection. It is pre-configured and can be used by
changing the settings:

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: config/settings.php | config.additional.php

    $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['messenger']['routing']['*'] = 'doctrine';

This will route all messages to the asynchronous transport (mind the :php:`*`).

..  attention::
    If you are using the Doctrine transport, make sure to take care of running
    the :ref:`consume command <message-bus-consume-command>`.

..  seealso::
    :ref:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['messenger']['routing'] <typo3ConfVars_sys_messenger_routing>`


..  _message-bus-consume-command:

Async message handling - The consume command
--------------------------------------------

To consume messages, run the command:

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Composer-based installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            vendor/bin/typo3 messenger:consume <receiver-name>

    ..  group-tab:: Legacy installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 messenger:consume <receiver-name>

By default, you should run:

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Composer-based installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            vendor/bin/typo3 messenger:consume doctrine

    ..  group-tab:: Legacy installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 messenger:consume doctrine

The command is a slimmed-down wrapper for the Symfony command
`messenger:consume`, it only provides the basic consumption functionality. As
this command is running as a worker, it is stopped after 1 hour to avoid memory
leaks. Therefore, the command should be run from a service manager like
`systemd`_ to restart automatically after the command exits due to the time
limit.

The following code provides an example for a service. Create the following
file on your server:

..  code-block:: ini
    :caption: /etc/systemd/system/typo3-message-consumer.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Run the TYPO3 message consumer
    Requires=mariadb.service
    After=mariadb.service

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/php8.1 /var/www/myproject/vendor/bin/typo3 messenger:consume doctrine --exit-code-on-limit 133
    # Generally restart on error
    Restart=on-failure
    # Restart on exit code 133 (which is returned by the command when limits are reached)
    RestartForceExitStatus=133
    # ..but do not interpret exit code 133 as an error (as it's just a restart request)
    SuccessExitStatus=133

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


Advanced usage
==============

..  _message-bus-custom-transport:

Configure a custom transport (Senders/Receivers)
------------------------------------------------

Transports are configured in the services configuration. To allow the
configuration of a transport per message, the TYPO3 configuration
(:file:`settings.php`, :file:`additional.php` on system level, or
:file:`ext_localconf.php` in an extension) is utilized. The transport/sender
name used in the settings is resolved to a service that has been tagged with
:yaml:`message.sender` and the respective identifier.

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: config/settings.php | config/additional.php | EXT:my_extension/ext_localconf.php

    $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['messenger'] = [
        'routing' => [
            // Use "messenger.transport.demo" as transport for DemoMessage
            \MyVendor\MyExtension\Queue\Message\DemoMessage::class => 'demo',

            // Use "messenger.transport.default" as transport for all other messages
            '*' => 'default',
        ]
    ];

..  literalinclude:: _custom-transport.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml | config/system/services.yaml

The TYPO3 Core has been tested with three transports:

*   :php:`\Symfony\Component\Messenger\Transport\Sync\SyncTransport`
    (default)
*   :php:`\Symfony\Component\Messenger\Bridge\Doctrine\Transport\DoctrineTransport`
    (using the Doctrine DBAL messenger transport)
*   :php:`\Symfony\Component\Messenger\Transport\InMemoryTransport`
    (for testing)


InMemoryTransport for testing
-----------------------------

The :php:`InMemoryTransport` is a transport that should only be used while
testing.

..  literalinclude:: _in-memory-transport.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml | config/system/services.yaml


Configure a custom middleware
-----------------------------

The middleware is set up in the services configuration. By default, the
:php:`\Symfony\Component\Messenger\Middleware\SendMessageMiddleware` and the
:php:`\Symfony\Component\Messenger\Middleware\HandleMessageMiddleware` are
registered. See also the `Custom middleware`_ section in the Symfony
documentation.

To add your own middleware, tag it as :yaml:`messenger.middleware` and set the
order using TYPO3's :yaml:`before` and :yaml:`after` ordering mechanism:

..  literalinclude:: _custom-middleware.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml | config/system/services.yaml
