====================
Create new Page Type
====================

The following example adds a new page type called "Archive".

..  include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/PageTypes/NewPageType.rst.txt

Changes need to be made in several files to create a new page type. Follow
the directions below to the end:

..  versionchanged:: 12.0
    A new :php:`PageDoktypeRegistry` was introduced replacing the
    :php:`$GLOBALS['PAGES_TYPES']` array. Use the version selector to look up
    the syntax in the corresponding documentation version for older TYPO3 versions.

The first step is to add the new page type to the
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\DataHandling\PageDoktypeRegistry`. Then you need to add
the icon chosen for the new page type and allow users to drag and drop the new
page type to the page tree.

The new page type is added to the :php:`PageDoktypeRegistry` in
:file:`ext_tables.php`:

..  literalinclude:: _ext_tables.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:examples/ext_tables.php

We need to add the following :ref:`user TSconfig <t3tsconfig:usertsconfig>`
to all users, so that the new page type is displayed in the wizard:

..  literalinclude:: _UserConfiguration.tsconfig
    :language: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:examples/Configuration/TsConfig/User/UserConfiguration.tsconfig

You can load the file like this:

..  literalinclude:: _ext_localconf.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:examples/ext_localconf.php

The :ref:`icon <icon>` is registered in :file:`Configuration/Icons.php`:

..  literalinclude:: _Icons.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:examples/Configuration/Icons.php

Furthermore we need to modify the configuration of page records. As one can modify the pages, we
need to add the new doktype as an select option and associate it with the configured icon. That is done in
:file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/pages.php`:


..  literalinclude:: _pages.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:examples/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/pages.php

As you can see from the example, to make sure you get the correct icons,
you can utilize :php:`typeicon_classes`.

It is possible to define additional type icons for special case pages:

*   Page contains content from another page `<doktype>-mountpoint`,
    For example: :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['pages']['ctrl']['typeicon_classes']['116-mountpoint']`.
*   Page is hidden in navigation `<doktype>-hideinmenu`
    For example: :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['pages']['ctrl']['typeicon_classes']['116-hideinmenu']`.
*   Page is the root of the site `<doktype>-root`
    For example: :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['pages']['ctrl']['typeicon_classes']['116-root']`.

..  note::

    Make sure to add the additional icons using the :ref:`Icon API <icon>`!
