============================
Context Sensitive Help (CSH)
============================

TYPO3 CMS offers a full API for adding Context Sensitive Help to
backend modules and - especially - to all database tables and fields.
CSH then appears either as a help icon in the docheader (for modules)
or as a popup on field labels when editing database records.
The text is meant to help the user understand what the module does
or what the database field means.

When hovering over a help icon or a field label with CSH,
the cursor transforms into a question mark. Clicking on the
element triggers the appearance of the popup window.

If the CSH contains more information, the bubble help displays a small
icon after the text (as in the screenshot above). Clicking on that icon
opens a popup window with lengthier explanations, possible enriched
with images.

Clicking on the "Back" icon at the top of the popup window leads
to a table of contents of all the available CSH.
