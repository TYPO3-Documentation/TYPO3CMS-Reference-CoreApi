Configuration
======================

A primary feature of TYPO3 is its configurability. Not only can
it be configured by users with special user privileges in the backend,
most configuration can also be changed by extensions or
configuration files. Additionally, configuration can be extended by
extensions.

This chapter will give you an overview of various configuration
methods in TYPO3. We will not go into detail, but rather show
a comparison of the various methods and resolve some common
sources of confusion.

For a more extensive introduction we will refer you to the
respective chapter or reference.
