Site sets
=========

..  versionadded:: 13.1
    Site sets have been introduced.

Site sets ship parts of the site configuration as composable pieces. They are
intended to deliver :ref:`settings <sitehandling-settings>`,
:ref:`TypoScript <t3tsref:start>` and
:ref:`page TSconfig <t3tsconfig:include-static-page-tsconfig-per-site>`
for the scope of a site.

Extensions can provide multiple sets in order to ship presets for different
sites or subsets (think of frameworks) where selected features are exposed
as a subset (example: `typo3/seo-xml-sitemap`).

..  _site-sets-definition:

Site set definition
===================

A site set definition contains the configuration for site settings, TypoScript
and PageTSConfig and can be assigned to one or more sites via the site module.
Site set definitions are created in the :path:`Configuration/Sets/` directory
and separated from each other by a sub-folder with any name. In this way,
it is also possible to create several site set definitions per extension. Each
of these sub-folders must have a :file:`config.yaml` that assigns at least a
unique `name` and preferably also a unique `label` to the site set definition.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Sets/MySet/config.yaml
    :linenos:

    name: my-vendor/my-set
    label: My Set
    settings:
      website:
        background:
          color: '#386492'
    dependencies:
      - my-vendor/my-other-set
      - other-namespace/fancy-carousel

Line 1: :yaml:`name: my-vendor/my-set`
    Site Set Name
    Similar to the package name of Composer: `[Vendor]/[Package]`
    Is required to uniquely identify the site set
    and to resolve dependencies to other site sets.
    This name does NOT reflect an extension, but only the provider of an
    extension through the vendor name.
    There are NO conclusions from the name here as to which extension
    provided the site set definition.
Line 2: :yaml:`label: My Set`
    This label will be used in the new select box of the site module. Should
    be as unique as possible to avoid duplication in the site module.
Line 3-6: Settings
    Define settings for the website
    **Never** nest settings with a dot! e.g. `website.background.color`
    Otherwise the new settings definitions will not work later.
    If a setting value contains special characters or spaces, it is recommended to
    wrap the value in single quotes. You can also define settings in a
    separate file :file:`settings.yaml`. See section below.
Line 7: Dependencies
    Load :file:`setup.typoscript`, :file:`constants.typoscript`,
    :file:`page.tsconfig` and :file:`config.yaml` from the site set definitions
    of this or other extensions. These dependencies are loaded before your own
    site set. For example a dependency to a site set definition in your own
    site package and/or a dependency to a site set definition from
    another provider (vendor)

..  _site-sets-hidden:

Hidden site sets
----------------

Sets may be hidden from the backend set selection in
:guilabel:`Site Management > Sites` and the console command
:bash:`bin/typo3 site:sets:list` by adding a `hidden` flag to the
:file:`config.yaml` definition:

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Sets/MyHelperSet/config.yaml

    name: my-vendor/my-helperset
    label: A helper Set that is not visible inside the GUI
    hidden: true

Integrators may choose to hide existing sets from the list of available
sets for backend users via user TSconfig, in case only a curated list of sets
shall be selectable:

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/user.tsconfig

    options.sites.hideSets := addToList(typo3/fluid-styled-content)

..  _site-sets-usage:

Using a site set as dependency in a site
========================================

Sets are applied to sites via `dependencies` array in site configuration:

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: config/sites/my-site/config.yaml

    base: 'https://example.com/'
    rootPageId: 1
    dependencies:
      - my-vendor/my-set

Site sets can also be added to a site via the backend module
:guilabel:`Site Management > Sites`.

..  _site-sets-settings-definition:

Settings definitions
====================

Settings can be defined in a file called :file:`settings.definitions.yaml` in
a set, for example :file:`EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Sets/MySet/settings.definitions.yaml`.

Read more about :ref:`site-settings-definition`.

Settings have a default value that can be
:ref:`overridden within a set <site-sets-settings>`.

..  _site-sets-settings:

Override site settings defaults in a subsets
============================================

Settings for subsets (for example to configure settings in declared dependencies)
can be shipped via :file:`settings.yaml` when placed next to the set file
:file:`config.yaml`.

Note that default values for settings provided by the set do not need to be
defined here, as defaults are to be provided within
:file:`settings.definitions.yaml`.

Here is an example where the setting `styles.content.defaultHeaderType` as
provided by `typo3/fluid-styled-content` is configured via
:file:`settings.yaml`:

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Sets/MySet/settings.yaml

    styles:
      content:
        defaultHeaderType: 1

This setting will be exposed as site setting whenever the set
`my-vendor/my-set` is applied as dependency to a site configuration.

..  _site-sets-typoscript:

TypoScript provider
===================

TypoScript dependencies can be included via set dependencies. This mechanism is
much more effective than the previous
:ref:`static includes <t3tsref:extdev-static-includes>` or manual
:typoscript:`@import` statements.

TypoScript dependencies via sets are automatically ordered and
deduplicated.

Set-defined TypoScript can be shipped within a set. The files
:file:`setup.typoscript` and :file:`constants.typoscript` (placed next to the
:file:`config.yaml` file) will be loaded, if available.
They are inserted (similar to `static_file_include`) into the TypoScript chain
of the site TypoScript that will be defined by a site that is using sets.

Set constants will always be overruled by site settings. Since site settings
always provide a default value, a constant will always be overruled by a defined
setting. This can be used to provide backward compatibility with TYPO3 v12
in extensions, where constants shall be used in v12, while v13 will always
prefer defined site settings.

In contrast to `static_file_include`, dependencies are to be included via
sets. Dependencies are included recursively. This mechanism supersedes the
previous include via `static_file_include` or manual :typoscript:`@import` statements as
sets are automatically ordered and deduplicated. That means TypoScript will not
be loaded multiple times, if a shared dependency is required by multiple sets.

..  note::
    :typoscript:`@import` statements are still fine to be used for local
    includes, but should be avoided for cross-set/extensions dependencies.

..  attention::
    If the website uses a mixed setup consisting of a TypoScript template (`sys_template`)
    and site sets, it is important to uncheck the "Clear" flag for constants and
    setup in the TypoScript template. If the "Clear" flag is checked (default),
    TypoScript settings from site sets are cleared and do therefore not apply.

..  _site-sets-page-tsconfig:

Page TSconfig provider
======================

Page TSconfig is loaded from a file :file:`page.tsconfig`, if placed next to the
site set configuration file :file:`config.yaml` and is scoped to pages within
sites that depend on this set.

Therefore, extensions can ship page TSconfig without the need for database entries or
by polluting global scope when registering page TSconfig globally via
:file:`ext_localconf.php` or :file:`Configuration/page.tsconfig`.
Dependencies can be expressed via sets, allowing for automatic ordering and
deduplication.

..  _site-sets-cli:

Analyzing the available site sets via console command
=====================================================

A list of available site sets can be retrieved with the console command
:bash:`bin/typo3 site:sets:list`:

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Composer-based installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            vendor/bin/typo3 site:sets:list

    ..  group-tab:: Legacy installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 site:sets:list


..  _site-sets-example-site-package:

Example: Using a set within a site package
==========================================

You can see an example of using a sets within a site package in the extension
`t3docs/site-package (Source on GitHub) <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-SitePackage-Code>`__.

The site package example extension has the following file structure:

..  directory-tree::
    :show-file-icons: true

    *   Configuration

        *   Sets

            *   SitePackage

                *   config.yaml
                *   constants.typoscript
                *   page.tsconfig
                *   settings.yaml
                *   setup.typoscript

            *   ...

    *   Resources

        *   ...

    *   composer.json
    *   ...

..  _site-sets-example-site-package-set:

Defining the site set with a fluid_styled_content dependency
------------------------------------------------------------

As our example site package only contains one site set the name of that set
is the same as the Composer name of the site package.

The site package depends on
:ref:`EXT:fluid_styled_content <typo3/cms-fluid-styled-content:start>`.
Therefore the two sets provided by that system extension are included as
dependencies:

..  include:: _Sets/_site-package/_config.rst.txt

If you need additional dependencies, you can find all available sets with the
console command :ref:`bin/typo3 site:sets:list <site-sets-cli>`.

..  _site-sets-example-usage:

Using the site set as dependency of a site
------------------------------------------

After the example site package is installed, you can include the site set
in your site configuration:

..  literalinclude:: _Sets/_site-package/_site_config.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :caption: config/sites/<some_site>/config.yaml | typo3conf/sites/<some_site>/config.yaml

..  _site-sets-example-typoscript:

Loading TypoScript via the site package's set
---------------------------------------------

The example site package also loads its TypoScript by placing the files
:file:`constants.typoscript` and :file:`setup.typoscript` into the folder of the
site set. These TypoScript files use :typoscript:`@import` statements to import
files from the extension's directory :path:`Configuration/TypoScript`:

..  include:: _Sets/_site-package/_setup.rst.txt

Dependant TypoScript is included by the dependant sets and not by
TypoScript imports.

..  _site-sets-example-settings:

Using the site set to override default settings
-----------------------------------------------

In this example the file
:file:`EXT:site_package/Configuration/Sets/SitePackage/settings.yaml`
is used to
override default settings made by the by the set of
:ref:`EXT:fluid_styled_content <typo3/cms-fluid-styled-content:start>`:

..  include:: _Sets/_site-package/_settings.rst.txt

..  _site-sets-example-extension:

Example: Providing a site set in an extension
=============================================

Non site-package extensions can also provide site sets. These can be used by
sites or site sets to include dependant TypoScript and settings.

The example extension :composer:`t3docs/blog-example` offers one main site set and several
site sets for special use-cases. It has the following file structure:

..  directory-tree::
    :show-file-icons: true

    *   Classes

        *   ...

    *   Configuration

        *   Sets

            *   BlogExample

                *   config.yaml
                *   constants.typoscript
                *   page.tsconfig
                *   setup.typoscript

            *   DefaultStyles

                *   config.yaml
                *   setup.typoscript

            *   RssFeed

                *   config.yaml
                *   constants.typoscript
                *   setup.typoscript

            *   ...

    *   Resources

        *   ...

    *   composer.json
    *   ...

..  _site-sets-example-extension-multiple-sets:

Multiple site sets to include separate functionality
----------------------------------------------------

The main site set of the extension has the same name like the Composer name:

..  include:: _Sets/_blog_example/_config.rst.txt

The other two sets depend on this set being loaded and therefore declare it
as dependency:

..  include:: _Sets/_blog_example/_default_config.rst.txt

..  include:: _Sets/_blog_example/_rss_config.rst.txt

The additional site sets provide TypoScript configuration that depends on
the base site set. They do not use :typoscript:`@include` statements to include
the base TypoScript. The dependencies defined in the site set take care of the
correct loading order of the TypoScript.

..  _site-sets-php-api:

Site Set PHP API
================

..  _site-sets-php-api-site:

Site
----

The site settings can be read out via the site object:

..  code-block:: php

    $color = $site->getSettings()->get('website.background.color');

If a settings definition exists for this setting, the returned value has
already been validated, converted and, if not set, the default value is used.

..  _site-sets-php-api-setregistry:

SetRegistry
-----------

The :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetRegistry` retrieves the site sets found in an ordered sequence, as
defined by `dependencies` in `config.yaml`. Please preferably use the site
object to access the required data. However, if you need to query one or more
site set definitions in order as defined by dependencies, then
:php-short:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetRegistry`
is the right place to go. To read all site set definitions, please
use :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetCollector`.

..  _site-sets-php-api-setregistry-getsets:

getSets
~~~~~~~

Reads one or more site set definitions including their dependencies.

..  code-block:: php

    $sets = $setRegistry->getSets('my-vendor/my-set', 'my-vendor/my-set');

..  _site-sets-php-api-setregistry-hasset:

hasSet
~~~~~~

Checks whether a site set definition is available.

..  code-block:: php

    $hasSet = $setRegistry->hasSet('my-vendor/my-set');

..  _site-sets-php-api-setregistry-getset:

getSet
~~~~~~

Reads a site set definition WITHOUT dependencies.

..  code-block:: php

    $set = $setRegistry->getSet('my-vendor/my-set');

..  _site-sets-php-api-setcollector:

SetCollector
~~~~~~~~~~~~

TYPO3 comes with a new `ServiceProvider`, which goes through all extensions
with the first instantiation of the :php-short:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetCollector` and reads all site set
definitions found.

..  code-block:: php

    public function __construct(
        #[Autowire(lazy: true)]
        protected SetCollector $setCollector,
    ) {}

However, this is not the official way to access the site set definitions and
their dependencies. Please access the configuration via the site object.
Alternatively, you can also use the :php-short:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetRegistry`, as only this manages the
site sets in the order declared by the dependency specification.

Only use the :php-short:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Site\Set\SetCollector` if you need to read all site set definitions.
Dependencies are not taken into account here.
