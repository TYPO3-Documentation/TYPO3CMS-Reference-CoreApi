Basics
======

.. note::
   Site handling as described here is available since TYPO3 9 LTS.

TYPO3 site handling and configuration is the starting point for creating new web sites. The corresponding modules are found in the TYPO3 backend
in the section "Site management".

A site configuration consists of the following parts:

* Base URL configuration: Under which domain(s) is my site accessible
* :ref:`Language configuration<sitehandling-addingLanguages>`: Which languages are available for my site
* :ref:`Error Handling<sitehandling-errorHandling>`: How should errors for this site behave (For example: configure custom 404 pages)
* :ref:`Static Routes<sitehandling-staticRoutes>`: Add static routes to a site (For example for robots.txt on a per site base)
* Routing Configuration: How shall routing behave for this site

When creating a new page on root level via TYPO3 Backend, a very basic site configuration is generated on the fly. It prevents immediate errors
due to missing configuration and can also serve as a starting point for all further actions.

Most parts of the site configuration can be edited via the graphical interface in the backend module "Site".

   The Site module in the TYPO3 backend.

.. hint::
   While the editing mask for a site looks like a "normal" TYPO3 editing form, it is not. In contrast to
   other forms, site configuration is stored in the file system and not in database tables.


.. index::
   Site handling; Directory
   Path; <project-root>/config/sites
   Path; typo3conf/sites

Site configuration storage
==========================

When creating a new site configuration, a folder in the file system is created located at
:file:`<project-root>/config/sites/<identifier>/`. The site configuration is stored in a
file called `config.yaml`.

.. note::
    If you are using a non-composer based installation, the location is `typo3conf/sites/`.
    In the future this folder can (and should) be used for more files like Fluid templates, and Backend layouts.

.. hint::
    Add this folder to your version control.

The configuration file
======================

The following part explains the configuration file and options:

        Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
        User-agent: *
        Allow: /
        Disallow: /forbidden/

Most settings can also be edited via the backend module `Site Management > Sites`,
exceptions being custom settings and additional routing configuration.


.. index:: Site handling; Site identifier

Site identifier
---------------

The site identifier is the name of the folder within `<project-root>/config/sites/` that will hold your configuration file(s). When
choosing an identifier make sure to stick to ASCII but you may also use `-`, `_` and `.` for convenience.


rootPageId
----------

Root pages are identified by one of these two properties:

* they are direct descendants of PID 0 (the root root page of TYPO3)
* they have the "Use as Root Page" property in `pages` set to true.

websiteTitle
------------

The title of the website which is used in title tags in the frontend.

base
----

The base is the base domain to run a site on. It either accepts a fully qualified URL or a relative segment "/" to react to any domain name.
It is possible to set a site base prefix to just "/site1" and "/site2" or "www.mydomain.com" instead of entering a full URI.

This allows to have a Site base e.g. www.mydomain.com to be detected with http and https protocols, although it is recommended to do a HTTP to
HTTPS redirect either on the webserver level, via a .htaccess rewrite rule, or by adding a redirect in TYPO3.

.. note::
  Please note that this flexibility will introduce side-effects when having multiple sites with mixed configuration settings as Site base:

  + Site 1: /mysite/
  + Site 2: www.mydomain.com

  will be unspecific when detecting a URL like www.mydomain.com/mysite/ and can lead to side-effects.

  In this case, it is necessary by the Site Administrator to define unique Site base prefixes.

languages
---------

Available languages for a site can be specified here. These settings determine language availability as well as behavior. For a detailed
description see  :ref:`Language configuration<sitehandling-addingLanguages>`.

errorHandling
-------------

The error handling section describes how to handle error status codes for this web site. It allows configuration of custom redirects,
rendering templates and more. For a detailed description see :ref:`error handling<sitehandling-errorHandling>`.

routes
------

The routes section is for adding static routes to a site, an example would be a :file:`robots.txt` or :file:`humans.txt` file that is
dependent on the current site (as opposed to containing the same content for the whole TYPO3 installation). Read more at
:ref:`static routes<sitehandling-staticRoutes>`

routeEnhancers
--------------

.. todo:: Add some more documentation here from the changelog?

While page routing works out of the box with no further settings, routeEnhancers allow the configuration of
routing for TYPO3 extensions. Read more at :ref:`routing-advanced-routing-configuration`
