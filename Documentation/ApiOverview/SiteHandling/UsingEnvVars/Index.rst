Using Environment Variables in Site Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

Environment Variables in site configuration allows setting placeholders for configuration options
that get replaced by environment variables specific to the current environment.

The format for environment variables is `%env(ENV_NAME)%`. Environment variables may be used to replace
complete values or parts of a value.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

	base: 'https://%env(BASE_DOMAIN)%/'


.. note::

    TYPO3 does not provide a loader for .env files - you have to take care of loading them yourself. Common options
    include setting environment configuration via server configuration or using `vlucas/phpdotenv <https://packagist.org/packages/vlucas/phpdotenv>`_.
