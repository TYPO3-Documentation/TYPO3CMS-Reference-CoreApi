.. _sitehandling-addingLanguages:

Adding languages
-----------------

The site module allows you to define which languages are active for your site, which languages are available in the frontend and how 
they should behave. 

For an explanation of each of the properties, see below.

When the backend shows the list of available languages - for instance in the page module language selector, when editing records and in the list module - the list of languages is now restricted to those defined by the site module.
If there are for instance five language records in the system, but a site configures only three of them for a page tree, only those three are considered when rendering language drop downs.

The language management comes with an option to hide a language in the frontend while allowing it in the backend. This allows editors to start translating pages without them directly being live. 

.. note::
      In case no site configuration has been created for a tree, all language records are shown. In this case the Page TSconfig options `mod.SHARED.defaultLanguageFlag`, `mod.SHARED.defaultLanguageLabel` and `mod.SHARED.disableLanguages` settings 
      are also considered - those are obsolete if a site configuration exists.

Language fallbacks can be configured for every language but the default one. A language fallback means that if content is not available in the current language, content of the fallback language will be displayed. This may include multiple fallback
levels - for example "Modern Chinese" might fall back to "Chinese (Traditional)" which may then fallback to "English". All languages can be configured separately, so you can have different fallback chains and behavior for each language.

.. tip::
    Used to older TYPO3 versions? The following TypoScript settings will be set based on `config.yaml` - you don't need to have them in your TypoScript
    template:

    * config.language
    * config.locale_all
    * config.htmlTag_dir
    * config.htmlTag_langKey
    * config.sys_language_uid
    * config.sys_language_mode
    * config.sys_language_isocode
    * config.sys_language_isocode_default
