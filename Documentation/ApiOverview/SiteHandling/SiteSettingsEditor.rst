Site settings editor
====================

..  versionadded:: 13.3
    The site setting editor has been introduced as backend module
    :guilabel:`Site Management > Settings`.

In module :guilabel:`Site Management > Settings` you get an overview of all sites in
the current installation and can edit the :ref:`sitehandling-settings` for
all pages that contain settings:

    :alt: Screenshot of the Site Settings module in overview

    Site "Home" has settings that can be edited. The others do not.

The settings editor displays the settings of all site sets included in the
current site, including their dependencies. The site sets can define categories
and subcategories to order the settings.

    The site in the examples includes the "My Sitepackage" and "Blog Example"
    sets. "My Sitepackage" depends on "Fluid Styled Content"

The settings to be displayed here have to be defined in an extension's or
site packages's set in a :ref:`setting definition <site-settings-definition>` file, for example
:file:`EXT:my_sitepackage/Configuration/Sets/MySitepackage/settings.definitions.yaml`.

Settings that have been made directly in the :file:`settings.yaml` file without a
corresponding entry in a :file:`settings.definitions.yaml` are not displayed in
the editor as they have neither a type nor a label. These values are, however,
retained when the editor writes to the :file:`settings.yaml` file.
