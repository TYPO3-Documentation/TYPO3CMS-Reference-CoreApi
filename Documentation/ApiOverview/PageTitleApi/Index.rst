PageTitle API
=============

In order to keep setting the titles in control, you can use the PageTitle API. The API uses :php:`PageTitleProviders`
to define the page title based on page record and the content on the page.

Based on the priority of the providers, the :php:`PageTitleProviderManager` will check the providers if a title
is given by the provider. It will start with the highest priority PageTitleProviders and will end with the lowest
in priority.

By default, the Core ships two providers. If you have installed the system extension SEO, the provider with the (by default) highest priority will be the
:php:`SeoTitlePageTitleProvider`. When an editor has set a value for the SEO title in the page properties of the page,
this provider will provide that title to the :php:`PageTitleProviderManager`. If you have not installed the SEO system
extension, this fields and provider are not available.

The fallback provider with the lowest priority is the :php:`RecordPageTitleProvider`. When no other title is set
by a provider, this provider will return the title of the page.

Besides the providers shipped by the Core, you can add own providers. An integrator can define the priority of the
providers for his project.

Create Your Own PageTitleProvider
=================================

Extension developers may want to have an own provider for page titles. For example if you have an extension with
records and a detail view, the title of the page record will not be the correct title. To make sure to display
the correct page title, you have to create your own :php:`PageTitleProvider`. It is quite easy to create one.

First of all create a PHP class in your extension that implements the :php:`PageTitleProviderInterface`, for example by extending :php:`AbstractPageTitleProvider`. This will force you to have at least the :php:`getTitle()` method in your class. Within this method you can create your own logic to define the correct title.

.. code-block:: php

   namespace Vendor\Extension\PageTitle;

   use TYPO3\CMS\Core\PageTitle\AbstractPageTitleProvider;

   class MyOwnPageTitleProvider extends AbstractPageTitleProvider
   {
       /**
        * @param string $title
        */
       public function setTitle(string $title)
       {
           $this->title = $title;
       }
   }


Usage example e.g. in an Extbase controller:

.. code-block:: php

   $titleProvider = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(MyOwnPageTitleProvider::class);
   $titleProvider->setTitle(‘Title from controller action’);


.. index:: PageTitle; Priority

Define priority of PageTitleProviders
=====================================

The priority of the providers are set by the TypoScript property :typoscript:`config.pageTitleProviders`. This
way an integrator is able to set the priorities for his project and can even have conditions in place.

By default, the Core has the following setup:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   config.pageTitleProviders {
        record {
            provider = TYPO3\CMS\Core\PageTitle\RecordPageTitleProvider
        }
   }

The ordering of the providers is based on the `before` and `after` parameters. If you want a provider to be handled
before a specific other provider, just set that provider in the `before`, do the same with `after`.

If you have installed the system extension SEO, you will also get a second provider. The configuration will be:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   config.pageTitleProviders {
      record {
         provider = TYPO3\CMS\Core\PageTitle\RecordPageTitleProvider
      }
      seo {
         provider = TYPO3\CMS\Seo\PageTitle\SeoTitlePageTitleProvider
         before = record
      }
   }

First the :php:`SeoTitlePageTitleProvider` (because it will be handled before record) and if this providers didn't
provide a title, the :php:`RecordPageTitleProvider` will be checked.

You can override these settings within your own installation. You can add as many providers as you want. Be aware
that if a provider returns a non-empty value, all provider with a lower priority won't be checked.
