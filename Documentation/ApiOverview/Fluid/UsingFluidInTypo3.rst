====================
Using Fluid in TYPO3
====================

Here are some examples of how Fluid can be used in TYPO3:

*  Create a template (theme) using a combination of TypoScript
   :ref:`FLUIDTEMPLATE <t3tsref:cobj-fluidtemplate>` and Fluid.
   Check out the :doc:`t3sitepackage:Index` which walks you through the
   creation of a sitepackage extension.
*  :ref:`adding-your-own-content-elements` in addition to the already existing
   content elements TYPO3 supplies.
*  The previous point describes the lightweight components which
   are created using a combination of TypoScript and Fluid. If you need more
   functionality or flexibility in your content element, you can create a
   content plugin using a combination of Extbase and Fluid.
*  Use Fluid to create emails using the :ref:`TYPO3 Mail API <mail-fluid-email>`.
*  Use Fluid in :ref:`backend modules <backend-modules-template>`, either with or
   without Extbase.
