==============================
Developing a custom ViewHelper
==============================

This chapter will demonstrate how to write a custom Fluid ViewHelper in TYPO3.

A "Gravatar" ViewHelper is created, which uses an email address as parameter
and shows the picture from gravatar.com if it exists.

The official documentation of Fluid for writing custom ViewHelpers can be found
within the Fluid documentation: :ref:`fluid:creating-viewhelpers`.

Fluid
=====

The custom ViewHelper is not part of the default distribution. Therefore a
namespace import is necessary to use this ViewHelper. In the following example,
the namespace :php:`\MyVendor\MyExtension\ViewHelpers` is imported with the
prefix `m`. Now, all tags starting with `m:` are interpreted as
ViewHelper from within this namespace:

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/SomeTemplate.html

    <html
        xmlns:f="http://typo3.org/ns/TYPO3/CMS/Fluid/ViewHelpers"
        xmlns:m="http://typo3.org/ns/MyVendor/MyExtension/ViewHelpers"
        data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true"
    >
        <!-- ... -->
    </html>

For further information about namespace import, see
:ref:`fluid-syntax-viewhelpers-import-namespaces`.

The ViewHelper should be given the name "gravatar" and only take an email
address as a parameter. The ViewHelper is called in the template as follows:

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/SomeTemplate.html

    <m:gravatar emailAddress="username@example.org" />

AbstractViewHelper implementation
=================================

Every ViewHelper is a PHP class. For the Gravatar ViewHelper, the name of the
class is :php:`\MyVendor\MyExtension\ViewHelpers\GravatarViewHelper`.

..  literalinclude:: _CustomViewHelper/_GravatarViewHelper.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php
    :linenos:


:php:`AbstractViewHelper`
-------------------------

*line 11*

Every ViewHelper must inherit from the class
:php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractViewHelper`.

A ViewHelper can also inherit from subclasses of :php:`AbstractViewHelper`, e.g.
from :php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`.
Several subclasses are offering additional functionality. The
:php:`TagBasedViewHelper` will be explained :ref:`later on in this chapter
<creating-xml-tags-using-tagbasedviewhelper>` in detail.

..  _fluid-viewhelper-custom-escaping-of-output:

Escaping of output
------------------

*line 15*

By default, all output is escaped by :php:`htmlspecialchars` to prevent cross
site scripting.

Setting the property :php:`$escapeOutput` to false is necessary to prevent
escaping of ViewHelper output.

By setting the property :php:`$escapeChildren` to false, escaping of the tag
content (its child nodes) can be disabled. If this is not set explicitly,
the value will be determined automatically: If :php:`$escapeOutput`: is true,
:php:`$escapeChildren` will be disabled to prevent double escaping. If
:php:`$escapeOutput`: is false, :php:`$escapeChildren` will be enabled unless
disabled explicitly.

Passing in children is explained in :ref:`prepare-viewhelper-for-inline-syntax`.

..  _fluid-viewhelper-custom-initializeArguments:

:php:`initializeArguments()`
----------------------------

*line 17*

The :php:`Gravatar` ViewHelper must hand over the email address which
identifies the Gravatar. Every ViewHelper has to declare which parameters are
accepted explicitly. The registration happens inside :php:`initializeArguments()`.

In the example above, the ViewHelper receives the argument `emailAddress` of
type `string`. These arguments can be accessed
through the array :php:`$arguments`, which is passed into the :php:`renderStatic()`
method (see :ref:`next section <fluid-viewhelper-custom-renderStatic>`).

..  tip::

    Sometimes arguments can take various types. In this case, the type `mixed`
    should be used.

..  _fluid-viewhelper-custom-renderStatic:

:php:`renderStatic()`
---------------------

*line 23*

The method :php:`renderStatic()` is called once the ViewHelper is rendered. The
return value of the method is rendered directly.

*line 13*

The trait :php:`CompileWithRenderStatic` must be used if the class implements
:php:`renderStatic()`.

..  _creating-xml-tags-using-tagbasedviewhelper:
..  _creating-html-tags-using-tagbasedviewhelper:

Creating HTML/XML tags with the :php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`
=================================================================

..  versionchanged:: Fluid Standalone 2.12 / TYPO3 13.2
    All TagBasedViewHelpers (such as :html:`<f:image />` or :html:`<f:form.*>`) can now receive
    arbitrary tag attributes which will be appended to the resulting HTML tag. In the past,
    this was only possible for a small list of tag attributes, like class, id or lang.

    See also :ref:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-registerTagAttribute-migration`.

For ViewHelpers which create HTML/XML tags, Fluid provides an enhanced base
class: :php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`.  This
base class provides an instance of
:php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\TagBuilder` that can be used to create
HTML-tags. It takes care of the syntactically correct creation and, for example,
escapes single and double quotes in attribute values. All TagBasedViewHelpers
can receive arbitrary tag attributes which will be appended to the resulting
HTML tag.

..  attention::

    Correctly escaping the attribute values is mandatory as it affects security
    and prevents cross-site scripting attacks.

Because the Gravatar ViewHelper creates an :html:`img` tag the use of the
:php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\TagBuilder` is advised:

..  literalinclude:: _CustomViewHelper/_GravatarTagBasedViewHelper.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php
    :linenos:

What is different in this code?

The attribute :php:`$escapeOutput` is no longer necessary.


..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper:

:php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`
---------------------------------

*line 6*

The ViewHelper does not inherit directly from :php:`AbstractViewHelper` but
from :php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`, which provides and initializes the tag builder.


..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-tagname:

:php:`$tagName`
---------------

*line 9*

There is a class property :php:`$tagName` which stores the name of the tag to be
created (:html:`<img>`).

..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-addAttribute:

:php:`$this->tag->addAttribute()`
---------------------------------

*line 23*

The tag builder is available at property :php:`$this->tag`. It offers the method
:php:`addAttribute()` to add new tag attributes. In our example the attribute
`src` is added to the tag.

..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-render:

:php:`$this->tag->render()`
---------------------------------

*line 27*

The GravatarViewHelper creates an img tag builder, which has a method named
:php:`render()`. After configuring the tag builder instance, the rendered tag
markup is returned.

..  note::

    As :php:`$this->tag` is an object property, :php:`render()` is used to
    generate the output. :php:`renderStatic()` would have no access. For further
    information take a look at :ref:`the-different-render-methods`.


..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-registerTagAttribute:

:php:`$this->registerTagAttribute()`
------------------------------------

..  deprecated:: Fluid standalone 2.12 / TYPO3 v13.2
    The methods php:`$this->registerTagAttribute()` and
    :php:`registerUniversalTagAttributes()` have been deprecated. They can be
    removed on dropping TYPO3 v12.4 support.

..  _AbstractTagBasedViewHelper-registerTagAttribute-migration:

Migration: Remove registerUniversalTagAttributes and registerTagAttribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  code-block:: diff
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php

      public function initializeArguments(): void
      {
          parent::initializeArguments();
    -     $this->registerUniversalTagAttributes();
    -     $this->registerTagAttribute('alt', 'string', 'Alternative Text for the image');
      }

When removing the call, attributes registered by the call are now available in
:php:`$this->additionalArguments`, and no longer in :php:`$this->arguments`.
This *may* need adaption within single ViewHelpers, *if* they handle such
attributes on their own.

If you need to support both TYPO3 v12.4 and 13, you can leave the calls
in until dropping TYPO3 v12.4 support.


..  code-block:: diff
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php

    public function initializeArguments(): void
    {
        parent::initializeArguments();
        // TODO: Remove registerUniversalTagAttributes and registerTagAttribute
        // On dropping TYPO3 v12.4 support.
        $this->registerUniversalTagAttributes();
        $this->registerTagAttribute('alt', 'string', 'Alternative Text for the image');
    }

..  _insert-optional-arguments:

Insert optional arguments
=========================

An optional size for the image can be provided to the Gravatar ViewHelper. This
size parameter will determine the height and width in pixels of the
image and can range from 1 to 512. When no size is given, an image of 80px is
generated.

The :php:`render()` method can be improved like this:

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php

    public function initializeArguments(): void
    {
       $this->registerArgument('emailAddress', 'string', 'The email address to resolve the gravatar for', true);
       $this->registerArgument('size', 'integer', 'The size of the gravatar, ranging from 1 to 512', false, 80);
    }

    public function render(): string
    {
       $this->tag->addAttribute(
          'src',
          'http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/' .
              md5($this->arguments['emailAddress']) .
              '?s=' . urlencode($this->arguments['size'])
       );
       return $this->tag->render();
    }

With this setting of a default value and setting the fourth argument to `false`,
the `size` attribute becomes optional.

..  _prepare-viewhelper-for-inline-syntax:

Prepare ViewHelper for inline syntax
====================================

So far, the Gravatar ViewHelper has focused on the tag structure of the
ViewHelper. The call to render the ViewHelper was written with tag syntax, which
seemed obvious because it itself returns a tag:

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/SomeTemplate.html

    <m:gravatar emailAddress="{post.author.emailAddress}" />

Alternatively, this expression can be written using the inline notation:

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/SomeTemplate.html

    {m:gravatar(emailAddress: post.author.emailAddress)}

One should see the Gravatar ViewHelper as a kind of post-processor for an email
address and would allow the following syntax:

..  code-block:: html
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/SomeTemplate.html

    {post.author.emailAddress -> m:gravatar()}

This syntax places focus on the variable that is passed to the ViewHelper as it
comes first.

The syntax `{post.author.emailAddress -> m:gravatar()}` is an alternative
syntax for `<m:gravatar>{post.author.emailAddress}</m:gravatar>`. To
support this, the email address comes either from the argument `emailAddress`
or, if it is empty, the content of the tag should be interpreted as email
address.

This is typically used with formatting ViewHelpers. These ViewHelpers all
support both tag mode and inline syntax.

Depending on the implemented method for rendering, the implementation is
different:

..  _with-renderstatic:

With :php:`renderStatic()`
--------------------------

To fetch the content of the ViewHelper, the argument
:php:`$renderChildrenClosure` is available.  This returns the evaluated object
between the opening and closing tag.

Lets have a look at the new code of the :php:`renderStatic()` method:

..  literalinclude:: _CustomViewHelper/_GravatarWithContentElementsViewHelper.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php
    :linenos:

..  _with-render:

With :php:`render()`
--------------------

To fetch the content of the ViewHelper the method :php:`renderChildren()` is
available in the :php:`AbstractViewHelper`. This returns the evaluated object
between the opening and closing tag.

Lets have a look at the new code of the :php:`render()` method:

..  literalinclude:: _CustomViewHelper/_GravatarTagBasedViewHelper2.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/GravatarViewHelper.php
    :linenos:

..  _handle-additional-arguments:

Handle additional arguments
===========================

If a ViewHelper allows further arguments which have not been explicitly
configured, the :php:`handleAdditionalArguments()` method can be implemented.

The :php:`\TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractTagBasedViewHelper` makes use
of this, to allow setting any `data-` argument for tag based ViewHelpers.

For example, the :php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper` implements the following:

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: EXT:fluid/Classes/ViewHelpers/AbstractTagBasedViewHelper.php

    public function handleAdditionalArguments(array $arguments)
    {
        $this->additionalArguments = $arguments;
        parent::handleAdditionalArguments($arguments);
    }

To keep the default behavior, all unwanted arguments should be passed to the
parent method call :php:`parent::handleAdditionalArguments($unassigned);`, to
throw exceptions accordingly.

..  _the-different-render-methods:

The different render methods
============================

ViewHelpers can have one or more of the following three methods for
implementing the rendering. The following section will describe the differences
between all three implementations.

..  _compile-method:

:php:`compile()`-Method
-----------------------

This method can be overwritten to define how the ViewHelper should be compiled.
That can make sense if the ViewHelper itself is a wrapper for another native PHP
function or TYPO3 function. In that case, the method can return the call to this
function and remove the need to call the ViewHelper as a wrapper at all.

The :php:`compile()` has to return the compiled PHP code for the ViewHelper.
Also the argument :php:`$initializationPhpCode` can be used to add further PHP
code before the execution.

..  note::

    The :php:`renderStatic()` method still has to be implemented for the non
    compiled version of the ViewHelper. In the future, this should no longer be
    necessary.

Example implementation:

..  literalinclude:: _CustomViewHelper/_StrtolowerViewHelper.php
    :language: php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/ViewHelpers/StrtolowerViewHelper.php

..  _renderstatic-method:

:php:`renderStatic()`-Method
----------------------------

Most of the time, this method is implemented. It's the one that is called by
default from within the compiled Fluid.

It is, however, not called on AbstractTagBasedViewHelper implementations. With these classes
you still need to use the :php:`render()` method since that is the only way you can access :php:`$this->tag`
which contains the tag builder that generates the actual XML tag.

As this method has to be static, there is no access to object properties such as
:php:`$this->tag` (in a subclass of :php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`) from within
:php:`renderStatic`.

..  note::

    This method can not be used when access to child nodes is necessary. This is
    the case for ViewHelpers like `if` or `switch` which need to access their
    children like `then` or `else`. In that case, :php:`render()` has to be used.

..  _render-method:

:php:`render()`-Method
----------------------

This method is the slowest one. Only use this method if it is necessary, for
example if access to properties is necessary.
