.. sidebar:: Sitepackage

   In TYPO3, (almost) everything is an extension. If you want to create a theme, override
   some configuration or add custom content elements you will do this in a custom TYPO3
   extension. A sitepackage is an extension that contains the foundation (in particular,
   the visual appearance) of a website: The configuration, necessary assets for a theme
   (images, css etc.) and a combination of TypoScript and Fluid.

You can use Fluid in TYPO3 to do one of the following:

* Create a template (theme) using a combination of TypoScript
  :ref:`FLUIDTEMPLATE <t3tsref:cobj-fluidtemplate>` and Fluid.
  Check out the :ref:`t3sitepackage:start` which walks you through the
  creation of a sitepackage extension.
* :ref:`adding-your-own-content-elements` in addition to the already existing content
  elements TYPO3 supplies.
* The previous point describes the lightweight components which
  are created using a combination of TypoScript and Fluid. If you need more functionality
  or flexibility in your content element, you can create a content plugin using
  a combination of Extbase and Fluid. This is explained in :ref:`t3extbasebook:start`
* Use Fluid to create emails using the :ref:`TYPO3 Mail API <mail-fluid-email>`.
* Use Fluid in :ref:`backend modules <backend-modules-template>`.

   This page was created recently to serve as a start page for Fluid in TYPO3.
   It contains an :ref:`fluid-introduction` as subpage and further pages will
   be added later.
