..  php:class:: ExpressionBuilder

    The ExpressionBuilder class is responsible for dynamically creating parts of
    SQL queries.

    It builds query conditions, ensuring that table and column names
    are quoted inside the expressions / SQL fragments. The class is a facade to
    the Doctrine ExpressionBuilder.

    The ExpressionBuilder is used in the context of the QueryBuilder to ensure
    that queries conform to the requirements of whichever database platform is in use.
