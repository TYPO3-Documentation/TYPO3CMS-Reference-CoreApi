..  php:class:: ExpressionBuilder

    ExpressionBuilder class is responsible to dynamically create SQL query parts.

    It takes care building query conditions while ensuring table and column names
    are quoted within the created expressions / SQL fragments. It is a facade to
    the actual Doctrine ExpressionBuilder.

    The ExpressionBuilder is used within the context of the QueryBuilder to ensure
    queries are being build based on the requirements of the database platform in
    use.
