..  warning::

    Make sure that you quote value identifiers and sub-expressions using
    QueryBuilder methods like :php:`quote()`, :php:`quoteIdentifier` or :php:`createNamedParameter`.
    Quotes are not added automatically.

    It is very important to quote values correctly so that you don't introduce SQL
    injection attack vectors into your application. See
    :ref:`this section of the query builder <database-query-builder-create-named-parameter>`
    for details.
