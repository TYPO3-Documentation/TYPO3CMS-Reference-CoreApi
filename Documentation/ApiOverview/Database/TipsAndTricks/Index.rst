Various Tips and Tricks
=======================

* Use `Find usages` of `PhpStorm` for examples! The source code of the Core is a great way to
  learn how specific methods of the API are used. In `PhpStorm` it is extremely helpful to right
  click on a single method and list all method usages with `Find usages`. This is especially handy
  to quickly see usage examples of complex methods like :php:`join()` from the `QueryBuilder`.

* `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements are often easier to read and write
  using the `Connection` object instead of the `QueryBuilder`.

* `SELECT DISTINCT aField` is not supported but can be substituted with a :php:`->groupBy('aField')`.

* :php:`getSQL()` and :php:`execute()` can be used after each other during development to simplify debugging::

     $queryBuilder
        ->select('uid')
        ->from('tt_content')
        ->where(
           $queryBuilder->expr()->eq('bodytext', $queryBuilder->createNamedParameter('klaus'))
        );
     debug($queryBuilder->getSql());
     $statement = $queryBuilder->execute();

* In contrast to the old API based on :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']`, Doctrine DBAL will throw exceptions
  if something goes wrong when calling :php:`execute()`. The exception type is a :php:`\Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException`
  which can be caught and transferred to a better error message if the application has to expect
  query errors. Note this is not good habit and often indicates an architectural flaw of the application
  at a different layer.

* :php:`count()` query types using the `QueryBuilder` typically call :php:`->fetchColumn(0)` to receive the count
  value. The :php:`count()` method of `Connection` object does that automatically and returns the count value
  result directly.
