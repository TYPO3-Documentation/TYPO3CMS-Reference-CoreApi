===========================
User settings configuration
===========================

The user settings module determines what user settings are available
for backend users. The users can access the settings by clicking on their name in
the :ref:`top bar <t3start:top-bar>` and then "User settings".

A number of settings such as backend language, password etc. are available
by default. These settings may be extended via extensions as described in
:ref:`user-settings-extending`.

The User Settings module has the most complex form in the TYPO3 backend
not driven by TCA/TCEforms. Instead it uses its own PHP configuration
array :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_USER_SETTINGS']`. It is quite similar to
:ref:`$GLOBALS['TCA'] <t3tca:start>`, but with less options.

The actual values can be accessed via the array :php:`$GLOBALS['BE_USER']->uc`
as described in :ref:`be-user-configuration`.
