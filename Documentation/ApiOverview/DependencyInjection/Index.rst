====================
Dependency injection
====================

.. versionadded:: 10.0

   :doc:`Changelog/10.0/Feature-84112-SymfonyDependencyInjectionForCoreAndExtbase`

TYPO3 uses a dependency injection solution based on the corresponding `PSR-11 <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/>`_
compliant Symfony component to standardize object initialization throughout the Core as well as in extensions.

The recommended way of injecting dependencies is to use constructor injection::

   public function __construct(Dependency $dependency)
   {
       $this->dependency = $dependency;
   }

By default all classes shipped by the TYPO3 Core  system extensions are available for dependency
injection.

.. _configure-dependency-injection-in-extensions:

Configure dependency injection in Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extensions have to configure their classes to make use of the
dependency injection. This can be done in :file:`Configuration/Services.yaml`.
Alternatively :file:`Configuration/Services.php` can be used.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Configuration/Services.yaml
    services:
      _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false

      Your\Namespace\:
        resource: '../Classes/*'

This is how a basic :file:`Services.yaml` of an extension looks like. The meaning of :yaml:`autowire`,
:yaml:`autoconfigure` and :yaml:`public` will be explained below.


.. note::

   Whenever service configuration or class dependencies change, the Core cache needs
   to be flushed to rebuild the compiled Symfony container.

.. _autowire:

Autowire
--------

:yaml:`autowire: true` instructs the dependency injection component
to calculate the required dependencies from type declarations. This works for constructor
and inject methods. The calculation yields to a service initialization recipe
which is cached in php code (in TYPO3 Core  cache).

.. note::

   An extension doesn't need to use autowiring, it is free to manually
   wire dependencies in the service configuration file.

Autoconfigure
-------------

It is suggested to enable :yaml:`autoconfigure: true` as this will automatically
add Symfony service tags based on implemented interfaces or base classes.
For example autoconfiguration ensures that classes which implement
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\SingletonInterface` will be publicly available from the
Symfony container.

Public
------

:yaml:`public: false` is a performance optimization and is therefore suggested to be
set in extensions. This settings controls which services are available
through :php:`\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface->get()`. However some classes, that need to
be public, will be marked public automatically due to :yaml:`autoconfigure: true`.
These classes include Singletons, because they need to be shared with code that uses
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance()` and Extbase controllers.

.. index:: Dependency injection; Public
.. _knowing-what-to-make-public:

Knowing what to make public
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instances of :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\SingletonInterface` and Extbase controllers are
marked public by default. Additionally some classes cannot be private as well.
As the Symfony documentation puts it:

.. this indent is intentional to create a blockquote!

    "Simply said: A service can be marked as private if you do not want to access it directly from your code."

    -- `Official documentation <https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/alias_private.html>`_ for public and private services.

Direct access includes instantiation via :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance()`.
This means every class that should make use of dependency injection and is not instantiated via injection
itself but by e.g. :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance()` have to be marked
as public. Some examples for this are:

* User Functions
* Non-Extbase Controllers
* Classes registered in Hooks

For such classes an extension can override the global :yaml:`public: false` configuration in the
:file:`Configuration/Services.yaml` for each class.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Configuration/Services.yaml
    services:
      _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false

      Vendor\MyExtension\:
        resource: '../Classes/*'

      Vendor\MyExtension\UserFunction\ClassA:
        public: true

With this configuration you can use dependency injection in :php:`\Vendor\MyExtension\UserFunction\ClassA`
when it is created in the context of a :ts:`USER` TypoScript object which would not be possible if this
class was private.

.. index:: Dependency injection; Errors
.. _errors-resulting-from-wrong-configuration:

Errors resulting from wrong configuration
-----------------------------------------

When objects using dependency injection are not configured properly, one or more
of the following issues can be the result. In such a case, check whether the
class has to be configured as :yaml:`public: true`.

:php:`ArgumentCountError` is raised on missing dependency injection for
:ref:`constructor-injection`:

.. code-block:: text

   (1/1) ArgumentCountError

   Too few arguments to function Vendor\ExtName\Namespace\Class::__construct(),
   0 passed in typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/GeneralUtility.php on line 3461 and exactly 1 expected

An :php:`Error` is raised on missing dependency injection for
:ref:`method-injection`, once the dependency is used within the code:

.. code-block:: text

   (1/1) Error

   Call to a member function methodName() on null


.. _supported-ways-of-dependency-injection:

Supported ways of dependency injection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Classes should be adapted to avoid both, :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Object\ObjectManager` and
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance()` whenever possible.
Class dependencies should be injected via constructor injection or
setter methods.

.. index:: Dependency injection; Constructor injection
.. _constructor-injection:

Constructor injection
---------------------

A class dependency can simply be specified as a constructor argument::

   public function __construct(Dependency $dependency)
   {
       $this->dependency = $dependency;
   }


.. index:: Dependency injection; Method injection
.. _method-injection:

Method injection
----------------

As an alternative to constructor injection :php:`injectDependency()` Methods can be used.
Additionally a :php:`setDependency()` will also work if it has the annotation :php:`@required`::


   /**
    * @param MyDependency $myDependency
    */
   public function injectMyDependency(MyDependency $myDependency)
   {
       $this->myDependency = $myDependency;
   }

   /**
    * @param MyOtherDependency $myOtherDependency
    * @required
    */
   public function setMyOtherDependency(MyOtherDependency $myOtherDependency)
   {
       $this->myOtherDependency = $myOtherDependency;
   }


.. index:: Dependency injection; Interface injection
.. _interface-injection:

Interface injection
-------------------

It is possible to inject interfaces as well. If there is only one implementation for a certain
interface the interface injection is simply resolved to this implementation::

   public function __construct(DependencyInterface $dependency)
   {
       $this->dependency = $dependency;
   }

When multiple implementation of the same interface exist, an extension needs to specify which
implementation should be injected when the interface is type hinted. Find out more about how this
is achieved in the official `Symfony documentation <https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/autowiring.html#working-with-interfaces>`_.
