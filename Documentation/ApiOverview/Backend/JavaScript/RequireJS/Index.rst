RequireJS (Deprecated)
======================

..  attention::
    ..  deprecated::  12.0
        The RequireJS project has been discontinued_ and was therefore
        replaced by native ECMAScript v6/v11 modules in TYPO3 v12.0. The
        infrastructure for configuration and loading of RequireJS
        modules is deprecated with v12.0 and will be removed in TYPO3 v13. See
        :ref:`RequireJS to ES6 migration <requirejs-migration>`.
