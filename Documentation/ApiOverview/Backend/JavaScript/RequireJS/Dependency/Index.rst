Dependency handling
===================

..  attention::
    ..  deprecated::  12.0
        The RequireJS project has been discontinued_ and was therefore
        replaced by native ECMAScript v6/v11 modules in TYPO3 v12.0. The
        infrastructure for configuration and loading of RequireJS
        modules is deprecated with v12.0 and will be removed in TYPO3 v13. See
        :ref:`RequireJS to ES6 migration <requirejs-migration>`.

.. _discontinued: https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/issues/1816

Let us try to explain the dependency handling with the most used JS lib: jQuery

To prevent the "$ is undefined" error, you should use the dependency handling of RequireJS.
To get jQuery working in your code, use the following line:

.. code-block:: js

   define(['jquery'], function($) {
      // in this callback $ can be used
   });

The code above is very easy to understand:

1. every dependency in the array of the first argument
2. will be injected in the callback function at the same position

Let us combine jQuery with our own module from the :ref:`Extension example <requirejs-extensions>`

.. code-block:: js

   define(['jquery', 'TYPO3/CMS/FooBar/MyMagicModule'], function($, MyMagicModule) {
      // $ is our jQuery object
      // MyMagicModule is the object, which is returned from our own module
      if(MyMagicModule.foo == 'bar'){
         MyMagicModule.init();
      }
   });
