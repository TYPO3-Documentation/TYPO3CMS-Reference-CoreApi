==================================
The page tree in the TYPO3 backend
==================================

The **page tree** is a hierarchical structure that represents pages and their
subpages on a website, allowing editors and integrators to easily organize and
manage content and navigation.

It is displayed on the left of backend modules with
:ref:`navigationComponent <t3coreapi:confval-backend-module-navigationcomponent>`
set to `'@typo3/backend/tree/page-tree-element'`.

Usage of the page tree is described in
`Getting Started Tutorial, Page tree <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:page-tree>`_.

The page tree can also be navigated via `Keyboard commands (Tutorial for
Editors) <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3editors:keyboard-commands>`_.
