Using FAL in the Frontend
=========================

TypoScript
==========

Using FAL relations in the frontend via TypoScript is achieved
using the :code:`FILES` content object, which is described
in details in the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:cobj-files>`.

The ImageViewHelper
-------------------

If you have the uid of a file reference, you can use it directly
in the :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\ViewHelpers\ImageViewHelper`:

.. code-block:: html

	<f:image image="{image}" />

Here :code:`{image}` is an object of one of the following types:

* :code:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\File`
* :code:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference`
* :code:`TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Domain\Model\FileReference`

Get file Properties
-------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: html

	{filereference.title}
	{filereference.description}
	{filereference.publicUrl}

.. tip::

   If you are in Extbase context, you usually have a :code:`TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Domain\Model\FileReference` Domain Model instead of a "pure" :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference` Object. In order to get the meta data, you need to resolve the    :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference` first by accessing the "originalResource" property:

.. code-block:: html

	{filereference.originalResource.title}
	{filereference.originalResource.description}
	{filereference.originalResource.publicUrl}

.. note::

   The system extension "filemetadata" (if installed) provides some additional meta data fields for files, for example :code:`creator`, :code:`publisher`, :code:`copyright` and others. To access those fields in the frontend, you have to use a proxy method named :code:`properties`:

.. code-block:: html

	{filereference.properties.copyright}
	{filereference.properties.creator}

.. tip::

   Please also note that the additional fields provided by the "filemetadata" extension are not listed as properties when you use :code:`<f:debug>` on a :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference` object.

*Note:* Some metadata fields, like title and description, can be entered either in the referenced file itself or in the reference or both. TYPO3 automatically merges both sources when you access originalResource in Fluid. So `originalResource` returns the merged value. Values which are entered in the reference will override values from the file itself.


.. _fal-using-fal-frontend-fluid-fluidtemplate:

FLUIDTEMPLATE
-------------

More often the file reference information will not be
available explicitly. The :ref:`FLUIDTEMPLATE <t3tsref:cobj-fluidtemplate>` content object
has a :ref:`dataProcessing <t3tsref:cobj-fluidtemplate-properties-dataprocessing>` property
which can be used to call up the :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\DataProcessing\FilesProcessor`
class, whose task it is to load all media referenced for the current
database record being processed.

This requires first a bit of TypoScript:

.. code-block:: typoscript

	lib.carousel = FLUIDTEMPLATE
	lib.carousel {
		file = EXT:extension/Resources/Private/Templates/Carousel.html
		dataProcessing.10 = TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\DataProcessing\FilesProcessor
		dataProcessing.10 {
			references {
				table = tt_content
				fieldName = image
			}
			as = images
		}
	}


This will fetch all files related to the content element being rendered
(referenced in the "image" field) and make them available in a variable
called :code:`images`. This can then be used in the Fluid template:

.. code-block:: html

	<f:for each="{images}" as="image">
		<div class="slide">
			<f:image image="{image.originalFile}" />
		</div>
	</f:for>
