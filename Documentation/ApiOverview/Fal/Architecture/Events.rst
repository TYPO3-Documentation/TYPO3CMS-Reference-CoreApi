=============
PSR-14 events
=============

The file abstraction layer (FAL) comes with a series of
:ref:`PSR-14 events <EventDispatcher>` that offer the opportunity to
hook into FAL processes at a variety of points.

They are listed below with some explanation, in particular when
they are sent (if the name is not explicit enough) and what
parameters the corresponding event will receive. They are grouped
by emitting class.

Most events exist in pairs, one being sent **before** a given
operation, the other one **after**.

..  note::
    Unless communicated otherwise, mentions of the :php:`File` class below
    actually refer to the :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileInterface` interface.

    :php:`Folder` objects actually refer to the
    :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Folder` class.

    Receives the file name to be created and
    the target folder (as a :php:`Folder` instance).

:ref:`AfterFileCreatedEvent`
    Receives the name of the newly created file and
    the target folder (as a :php:`Folder` instance).

    Receives a :php:`File` instance for the file that was renamed
    and the sanitized new name.

    Receives a :php:`File` instance for the file to be replaced
    and the path to the local file that will replace it.

:ref:`AfterFileReplacedEvent`
    Receives a :php:`File` instance for the file that was replaced
    and the path to the local file that has replaced it.

:ref:`BeforeFileContentsSetEvent`
    Receives a :php:`File` instance
    for the file whose content will be changed and the content itself
    (as a string).

:ref:`AfterFileContentsSetEvent`
    Receives a :php:`File` instance
    for the file whose content was changed and the content itself
    (as a string).

    parent folder, if any (as a :php:`Folder` instance).

:ref:`AfterFolderAddedEvent`
    Receives the newly created folder (as a :php:`Folder` instance).

:ref:`BeforeFolderCopiedEvent`
    Receives references to the folder to copy and the parent target folder
    (both as :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FolderInterface` instances)
    and the sanitized name for the copy.

:ref:`AfterFolderCopiedEvent`
    Receives references to the original folder and the parent target folder
    (both as :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FolderInterface` instances)
    and the identifier of the newly copied folder.

:ref:`BeforeFolderMovedEvent`
    Receives references to the folder to move and the parent target folder
    (both as :php:`Folder` instances) and the sanitized target name.

    instance) and the sanitized new name.

:ref:`AfterFolderRenamedEvent`
    Receives a reference to the renamed folder (as a :php:`Folder` instance)
    and the new identifier of the renamed folder.

:ref:`GeneratePublicUrlForResourceEvent`
    This event makes it possible to influence the construction of the public URL
    of a resource. If the event defines the URL, it is kept as is and the rest
    of the URL generation process is ignored.

    It receives a reference to the instance for which the URL should be generated
    (as a :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\ResourceInterface` instance),
    a boolean flag indicating whether the URL should be relative to the current
    script or absolute and a reference to the public URL (which is null at
    this point, but can be then modified by the event).

    file. The event receives the metadata as an :php:`\ArrayObject` instance.

:ref:`AfterFileMetaDataCreatedEvent`

    just after it has been inserted into the
    :ref:`sys_file_metadata <fal-architecture-database-sys-file-metadata>` table.

    updated. The event receives the metadata as an array containing all
    metadata fields (and not just the updated ones).
