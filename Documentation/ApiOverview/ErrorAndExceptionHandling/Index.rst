============================
Error and Exception Handling
============================

Since version 4.3.0 TYPO3 comes with an build-in error and exception
handling system. Admins can configure how errors and exceptions should
be displayed in Backend and Frontend. Errors and exception can be
logged to all available logging systems in TYPO3 including
:code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::syslog()` which is – among other features – able to send
error messages by mail (see example setups below).
