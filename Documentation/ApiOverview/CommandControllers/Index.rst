======================
Console commands (CLI)
======================

It is possible to run TYPO3 scripts from the command line.
This functionality can be used to set up cron jobs, for example.

TYPO3 uses Symfony commands API for writing CLI (command line interface) commands.
These commands can also be run from the TYPO3
:ref:`scheduler <symfony-console-commands-scheduler>` if this option is not
disabled in the :file:`Configuration/Services.yaml`.

..  attention::
    Using :ref:`Extbase <extbase>` repositories in CLI context is not
    recommended as Extbase relies on frontend :ref:`TypoScript <t3tsref:start>`.
    For example,
    :ref:`conditions using the request object <t3tsref:condition-function-request>`
    may cause problems. Use the :ref:`query builder <database-query-builder>`
    or :ref:`DataHandler <datahandler-basics>` where appropriate.

Run a command from the command line
=====================================

You can list the available commands by calling:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Composer-based installation

      .. code-block:: bash

         vendor/bin/typo3

   .. group-tab:: Legacy installation

      .. code-block:: bash

         typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3

For example, you can clear all caches by calling:

.. include:: /_includes/CliCacheFlush.rst.txt

Show help for the command:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Composer-based installation

      .. code-block:: bash

         vendor/bin/typo3 cache:flush -h

   .. group-tab:: Legacy installation

      .. code-block:: bash

         typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 cache:flush -h


.. _symfony-console-commands-scheduler:

Running the command from the scheduler
======================================

By default, it is possible to run a command from the :doc:`TYPO3 scheduler
<ext_scheduler:Index>` as well. To do this, select the task :guilabel:`Execute console commands`
followed by your command in the :guilabel:`Schedulable Command` field.

.. note::
   You need to save and reopen the task to define command arguments.

In order to prevent commands from being set up as scheduler tasks,
see :ref:`deactivating-the-command-in-scheduler`.

Create a custom command
=======================

See the :ref:`Tutorial: Create a console command <console-command-tutorial>`
for details on how to create commands.

DataHandler usage
=================
Using the :ref:`DataHandler <datahandler-basics>` in a CLI command requires
backend authentication.
See :ref:`dataHandler-cli-command` for more information.
