List of TYPO3 console commands
==============================

..  todo: List all common commands once https://forge.typo3.org/issues/103858 is resolved

By default TYPO3 ships the listed console commands, depending
on which system extensions are installed.

Third party extensions can define :ref:`custom console
commands <console-command-tutorial>`.

The extension :t3ext:`typo3_console` ships many commands to execute TYPO3
actions, which otherwise would only be accessible via the TYPO3 backend.

This page assumes that the code is run on a Composer based installation with
default binaries location. Here you can read how to run them in general and
on legacy installations:
:ref:`Run a command from the command line <symfony-console-commands-cli>`.
