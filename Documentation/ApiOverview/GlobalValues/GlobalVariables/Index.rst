Exploring global variables
==========================

Many of the global variables described above can be inspected using the
**ADMIN TOOLS > Configuration** module.

.. warning::
   This module is always viewed in the BE context. Variables defined
   only in the FE context will not be visible there.

.. note::

   This module is purely a browser. It does not let you change
   values.

   It also lets you browse a number of other global arrays.
   Just be curious and investigate!
