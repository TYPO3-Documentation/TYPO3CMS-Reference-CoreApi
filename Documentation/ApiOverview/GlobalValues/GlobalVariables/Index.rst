Global variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   Variables in italics *may* be set in a script prior to
   the bootstrap process so they are optional.

.. note::

   To make the table below a bit more compact, namespaces were left out. Here
   are the fully qualified class names referred to below:

   - "SystemEnvironmentBuilder" = :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\SystemEnvironmentBuilder`
   - "Bootstrap" = :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Bootstrap`
   - "PackageManager" = :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Package\PackageManager`
