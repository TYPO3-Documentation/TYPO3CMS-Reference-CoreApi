   inclusion of :file:`init.php` so they are optional.

.. note::

   To make the table below a bit more compact, namespaces were left out. Here
   are the fully qualified class names referred to below:

   - "SystemEnvironmentBuilder" = :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\SystemEnvironmentBuilder`
   - "Bootstrap" = :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Bootstrap`

         :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\DatabaseConnection` contains MySQL wrapper functions so you easily swap all
