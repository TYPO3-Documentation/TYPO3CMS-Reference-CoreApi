============================================
Cropping Variants in image manipulation tool
============================================

The `imageManipulation` TCA type is capable to handle multiple crop variants if configured.

The default configuration is to have only one variant with the same possible aspect ratios
like in older TYPO3 versions.

For that the TCA configuration has been extended.
