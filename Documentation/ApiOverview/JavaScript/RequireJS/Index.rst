==============================
RequireJS in the TYPO3 Backend
==============================

Since TYPO3 CMS 7 it is possible to use RequireJS in the backend.
A short explanation: RequireJS enables developers to have some kind of
dependency handling for JavaScript. The JavaScript is written as so-called
"Asynchronous Module Definition" (AMD).
Some libraries delivered with TYPO3 are written as modules.

The complete documentation about RequireJS was inspired by the
`blog post of Andreas Fernandez <https://scripting-base.de/blog/requirejs-backend.html>`__.
