Logging with TYPO3
------------------

TYPO3 Logging consists of the following components:

- A :ref:`Logger <logging-logger>` that receives the log message and related details, like a severity
- A :ref:`LogRecord model <logging-model>` which encapsulates the data
- :ref:`Configuration <logging-configuration>` of the logging system
- :ref:`Writers <logging-writers>` which write the log records to different targets
  (like file, database, rsyslog server, etc.)
- :ref:`Processors <logging-processors>` which add more detailed information to the log record.

Quick Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Instantiate a logger for the current class:

.. code-block:: php

   /** @var $logger \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\Logger */
   $logger = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance('TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogManager')->getLogger(__CLASS__);

Log a simple message:

.. code-block:: php

   $logger->info('Everything went fine.');
   $logger->warning('Something went awry, check your configuration!');

Provide additional information with the log message:

.. code-block:: php

   $logger->error(
     'This was not a good idea',
     array(
       'foo' => $bar,
       'bar' => $foo,
     )
   );

:code:`$logger->warning()` etc. are only shorthands - you can also call :code:`$logger->log()` directly
and pass the severity level:

.. code-block:: php

   $logger->log(
   	\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::CRITICAL,
   	'This is an utter failure!'
   );


By default the log entries are written to file :file:`typo3temp/logs/typo3.log`.
A sample output looks like this::

   Fri, 08 Mar 2013 09:45:00 +0100 [INFO] request="5139a50bee3a1" component="TYPO3.Examples.Controller.DefaultController": Everything went fine.
   Fri, 08 Mar 2013 09:45:00 +0100 [WARNING] request="5139a50bee3a1" component="TYPO3.Examples.Controller.DefaultController": Something went awry, check your configuration!
   Fri, 08 Mar 2013 09:45:00 +0100 [ERROR] request="5139a50bee3a1" component="TYPO3.Examples.Controller.DefaultController": This was not a good idea - {"foo":"bar","bar":{}}
   Fri, 08 Mar 2013 09:45:00 +0100 [CRITICAL] request="5139a50bee3a1" component="TYPO3.Examples.Controller.DefaultController": This is an utter failure!
