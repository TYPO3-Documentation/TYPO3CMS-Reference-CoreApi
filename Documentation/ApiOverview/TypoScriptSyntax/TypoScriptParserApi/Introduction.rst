Introduction
============

If you want to deploy `TypoScript`:pn: in your own `TYPO3 CMS`:pn: applications it is
really easy. The `TypoScript`:pn: parser is readily available to you and the
only thing that may take a little more effort than the instantiation
of PHP is if you want to define conditions for `TypoScript`:pn:.

Basically this chapter will teach you how you can parse your own
`TypoScript`:pn: strings into a PHP array structure. The exercise might even
help you to further understand the straight forward nature of
TypoScript.

.. note::

   The following pages are for experienced `TYPO3 CMS`:pn: developers
   and require a good knowledge of PHP.
