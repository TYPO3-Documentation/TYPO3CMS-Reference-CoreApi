Caching in TYPO3
----------------

TYPO3 uses multiple caching strategies to ensure fast content delivery. Depending
on the content a page contains, TYPO3 chooses the best strategy for the usage of caches.
Each page has its own cache entry. There is no duplication of a cache between different pages. 

For example, you might have a fully-cacheable page, a page that is at least partially
cacheable or a page that is completely dynamic. Dynamic elements in TYPO3 are also known
as `USER_INT` or `COA_INT` objects - as these are the matching TypoScript objects used
to render non-cacheable content. Or they are added in the file file:`localconf.php` of an
Extbase extension by the call of `\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin` 
with the 4th parameter which is for non-cacheable actions.

When visiting a TYPO3 web site, TYPO3 knows the following states:

#. first time hit:
   A page has never been rendered ("cache miss").
#. consecutive hit:
   A page has been rendered before ("cache hit")

In the first case, TYPO3 renders the complete page and writes cache entries as
configured. In the second case, TYPO3 fetches those entries from the cache and
delivers them to the user without re-triggering the rendering.

In that second case, either the page is fully cached and directly delivered from
the cache, or the page is cached but has also non-cacheable elements on it. 
If a page has non-cacheable elements, TYPO3 first fetches the cached part of the page and 
then renders all dynamic parts.

.. note::

   A stored cache contains placeholders for dynamic elements to tell TYPO3 where it has to render
   which dynamic parts.


.. hint::

   For developers: If you are developing a plugin, think about your plugin's cache lifetime.
   Ideally, it can be fully in the cache for a long time. But if not, make the extension uncached and follow 
   the steps in the section about the caching framework
   in order to leverage TYPO3's caching mechanism. This is a means to cache your plugin for however long
   you can - even only 30 seconds might improve performance in some scenarios.
   There are also cache options in TypoScript which may help to simplify this:

Caching Variants - or: What is a "cache hash"?
----------------------------------------------

TYPO3 ideally delivers fully cached pages for maximum performance. However, in scenarios where
the same page will deliver different content depending on URL parameters, TYPO3 needs a possibility
to identify these "variants" and cache each of them differently. For example, if you have a
news plugin and a detail page, the detail page is different for every news entry.

To identify the variant, TYPO3 combines a set of parameters and generates a hash value as identifier.
These parameters include by default:

- `id`: The current page ID
- `type`: The current page type (`typeNum`)
- `groupIds`: The user groups of the logged in user (if no user is logged in: 0, -1 as default values)
- `MP`: The mount point identifier
- `site`: The current site and base URL
- `staticRouteArguments`: Any route argument configured in the routing configuration and resolved in the current request
- `dynamicArguments`: Any :php:`$_GET` parameters influencing the rendered page

Imagine the following URL `https://example.com/news/?tx_example_news[id]=123` displaying the news with ID `123`.
If TYPO3 would cache that page with that parameter without any security mechanisms, it would open a potential
denial of service attack as an unlimited amount of cache entries could be generated by adding arbitrary parameters.
To avoid that, TYPO3 generates a so-called `cHash` parameter, which is a hash that basically signs the valid parameters
for that request. So any parameter that validly influences the rendered page needs to be part of that `cHash`.

With :ref:`Routing` you can configure TYPO3 not to display the `cHash` in your URLs in most cases.
Routing adds an explicit mapping of incoming readable URL slugs to internal parameter values.
This both adds an additional layer for validating slugs as well as reduces the parameters to a limited (and predictable) set of values.

Various configuration options exist to configure the `cHash` behavior via :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash']`
in the file :file:`LocalConfiguration.php` or :file:`AdditionalConfiguration.php`:

================================== ====================================================================================================================================================================
Option                             Description
================================== ====================================================================================================================================================================
cachedParametersWhiteList          Only the given parameters will be evaluated in the cHash calculation. Example: tx_news_pi1[uid]
requireCacheHashPresenceParameters Configure Parameters that require a cHash. If no cHash is given but one of the parameters are set, then TYPO3 triggers the configured cHash Error behavior
excludedParameters                 The given parameters will be ignored in the cHash calculation. Example: L,tx_search_pi1[query]
excludedParametersIfEmpty          Configure Parameters only being relevant for the cHash if there's an associated value available. Set excludeAllEmptyParameters to true to skip all empty parameters.
excludeAllEmptyParameters          If true, all parameters which are relevant for cHash are only considered if they are non-empty.
================================== ====================================================================================================================================================================

All properties can be configured with an array of values. Besides exact matches (*equals*) it is possible to apply partial matches at
the beginning of a parameter (*startsWith*) or inline occurrences (*contains*).

URL parameter names are prefixed with the following indicators:
+ :php:`=` (*equals*): exact match, default behavior if not given
+ :php:`^` (*startsWith*): matching the beginning of a parameter name
+ :php:`~` (*contains*): matching any inline occurrence in a parameter name

These indicators can be used for all previously existing sub-properties
:php:`cachedParametersWhiteList`, :php:`excludedParameters`, :php:`excludedParametersIfEmpty`
and :php:`requireCacheHashPresenceParameters`.

Example (excerpt of `LocalConfiguration.php`)
---------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash'] = [
     'excludedParameters' => [
       'utm_source',
       'utm_medium',
     ],
     'excludedParametersIfEmpty' => [
       '^tx_my_plugin[aspects]',
       'tx_my_plugin[filter]',
     ],
   ];


For instance instead of having ti exclude items like

.. code-block:: php

   'excludedParameters' => [
      'tx_my[data][uid]',
      'tx_my[data][category]',
      'tx_my[data][order]',
      'tx_my[data][origin]',
      ...
   ],

partial matches allow to simplify the configuration and consider all items having
:php:`tx_my[data]` (or :php:`tx_my[data][` to be more specific) as prefix like

.. code-block:: php

   'excludedParameters' => [
      '^tx_my[data][',
      ...
   ],


Caching Framework
-----------------

Since TYPO3 CMS 4.3, the Core contains a data caching framework
which supports a wide variety of storage solutions and options
for different caching needs. Each cache can be configured individually
and can implement its own specific storage strategy.

The caching framework exists to help speeding up TYPO3 sites, especially heavily loaded ones.
It is possible to move all caches to a dedicated cache server with specialized cache systems
like the Redis key-value store (a so called `NoSQL database <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL>`_).

Major parts of the original caching framework were formerly backported from TYPO3 Flow.
