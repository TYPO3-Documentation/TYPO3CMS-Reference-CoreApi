File functions basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File operations in the TCE are handled by the class
:code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\File\ExtendedFileUtility`
which extends :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\File\BasicFileUtility`.
The instructions for file manipulation are passed to this class as a
multidimensional array.

   :Description:
         Integer index in the array which separates multiple commands of the
         same type.


 - :Key:
         key
   :Type:
         string
   :Description:
         Depending on the command type. The keys will carry the information
         needed to perform the action. Typically a "target" key is used to
         point to the target directory or file while a "data" key carries the
         data.

Command keywords and values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. t3-field-list-table::

 - :Command,20: Command
   :Keys,20: Keys
   :Value,60: Value


 - :Command:
         delete
   :Keys:
         "data"
   :Value:
         "data" = Absolute path to the file/folder to delete


 - :Command:
         copy
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"

         "altName"
   :Value:
         "data" = Absolute path to the file/folder to copy

         "target" = Absolute path to the folder to copy to (destination)

         "altName" = (boolean): If set, a new filename is made by appending
         numbers/unique-string in case the target already exists.


 - :Command:
         move
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"

         "altName"
   :Value:
         (Exactly like copy, just replace the word "copy" with "move")


 - :Command:
         rename
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"
   :Value:
         "data" = New name, max 30 characters alphanumeric

         "target" = Absolute path to the target file/folder


 - :Command:
         newfolder
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"
   :Value:
         "data" = Folder name, max 30 characters alphanumeric

         "target" = Absolute path to the folder where to create it


 - :Command:
         newfile
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"
   :Value:
         "data" = New filename

         "target" = Absolute path to the folder where to create it


 - :Command:
         editfile
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"
   :Value:
         "data" = The new content

         "target" = Absolute path to the target file


 - :Command:
         upload
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"

         upload\_$id
   :Value:
         "data" = ID-number (points to the global var that holds the filename-
         ref (:code:`$_FILES["upload_" . $id]["name"]`).

         "target" = Absolute path to the target folder (destination)

         upload\_$id = File reference. $id must equal value of
         :code:`file[upload][...][data]`!

         See :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\File\ExtendedFileUtility::func_upload()`.


 - :Command:
         unzip
   :Keys:
         "data"

         "target"
   :Value:
         "data" = Absolute path to the zip-file. (file extension must be "zip")

         "target" = The absolute path to the target folder (destination) (if
         not set, default is the same as the zip-file)

It is unlikely that you will need to use this internally in your
scripts like you will need :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\DataHandling\DataHandler`. It is fairly uncommon to
need the file manipulations in own scripts unless you make a special
application. Therefore the most typical usage of this API is from
:ref:`tce\_file.php <tce-file-api>` and the core scripts that are activated by the "File >
List" module.

However, if you need it this is an example (taken from :file:`tce_file.php`)
of how to initialize the usage.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

       // Initializing:
   $this->fileProcessor = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance('TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Utility\\File\\ExtendedFileUtility');
   $this->fileProcessor->init($FILEMOUNTS, $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['fileExtensions']);
   $this->fileProcessor->init_actionPerms($BE_USER->user['fileoper_perms']);

   $this->fileProcessor->start($this->file);
   $this->fileProcessor->processData();

Line 2 makes an instance of the class and line 3 initializes the
object with the filemounts of the current user and the array of
allow/deny file extensions in web-space and ftp-space (see below).
Then the file operation permissions are loaded from the user object in
line 4. Finally, the file command array is loaded in line 6 (and
internally additional configuration takes place from
:code:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']`!). In line 7 the command map is executed.


.. _tce-file-extensions-control:

Configure file extensions via $GLOBALS['TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS']['BE']['fileExtensions']
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

File extensions can be configured via :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['fileExtensions']`.
For legacy reasons you have to add the sub-key :php:`webspace` in
TYPO3 8LTS.

The control is done like this: if an extension matches 'allow' then
the check returns true. If not and an extension matches 'deny' then
the check return false. If no match at all, returns true.

You list extensions comma-separated. If the value is a '\*' every
extension is matched. If no file extension is given, true is returned if
'allow' is '\*', false if 'deny' is '\*' and true if none of these
matches. This (default) configuration below accepts everything
except php files::

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['fileExtensions'] = array (
       'webspace' => array('allow' => '', 'deny' => 'php')
   );
