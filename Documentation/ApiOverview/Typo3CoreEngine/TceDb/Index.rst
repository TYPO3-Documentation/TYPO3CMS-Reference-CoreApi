.. _tce-db-api:

The "tce\_db.php" API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This script is a gateway for POST forms to class :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\DataHandling\DataHandler`. It
has historically been *the* script to which data was posted when you
wanted to update something in the database.

Today it is used for editing by only a few scripts, actually only the
"Quick Edit" module in "Web>Page" (frontend). The standard forms you
find in TYPO3 are normally rendered and handled by :file:`alt_doc.php`
which includes :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\DataHandling\DataHandler` on its own.

For commands it is still used from various locations.

You can send data to this file either as GET or POST vars where POST
takes precedence. The variable names you can use are:

.. t3-field-list-table::
 :header-rows: 1

 - :Variable,20: GP var name
   :Type,20: Data type
   :Description,60: Description


 - :Variable:
         data
   :Type:
         array
   :Description:
         Data array on the form :code:`[tablename][uid][fieldname] = value`.

         Typically it comes from a POST form which submits a form field like
         :code:`<input name="data[tt_content][123][header]" value="This is the
         headline" />`.


 - :Variable:
         cmd
   :Type:
         array
   :Description:
         Command array on the form :code:`[tablename][uid][command] = value`. This
         array may get additional data set internally based on clipboard
         commands send in CB var!

         Typically this comes from GET vars passed to the script like
         :code:`&cmd[tt\_content][123][delete]=1` which will delete Content Element
         with UID 123.
