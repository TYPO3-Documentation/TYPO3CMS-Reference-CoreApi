=======================
The "tce\_file.php" API
=======================

This script serves as the file administration part of the TYPO3 Core
Engine. It's a gateway for TCE (TYPO3 Core Engine) file-handling
through POST forms. It uses :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\File\ExtendedFileUtility` for the manipulation
of the files.

This script is used from the File > List module where you can rename,
create, delete etc. files and directories on the server.

You can send data to this file either as GET or POST vars where POST
takes precedence. The variable names you can use are:
