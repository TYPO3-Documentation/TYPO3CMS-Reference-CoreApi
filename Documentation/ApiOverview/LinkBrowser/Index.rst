The :ref:`LinkBrowser <linkbrowser-api>` is the window in which users can configure
links in both the :ref:`rte` and the :ref:`FormEngine`. The LinkBrowser offers
tabs for the different types of links like email, page, external, file, news
record and maybe more.

Each tab of the LinkBrowser has an associated :ref:`LinkHandler <linkhandler>`.
