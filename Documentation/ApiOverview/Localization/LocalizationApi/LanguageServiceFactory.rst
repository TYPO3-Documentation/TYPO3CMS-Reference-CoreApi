The :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Localization\LanguageServiceFactory` class is
for retrieving the :ref:`LanguageService <LanguageService-api>`
at runtime, which then is used to translate strings in plain PHP. For examples
see :ref:`extension-localization-php`. Creates a :ref:`LanguageService-api`
that can then be used for localizations.
