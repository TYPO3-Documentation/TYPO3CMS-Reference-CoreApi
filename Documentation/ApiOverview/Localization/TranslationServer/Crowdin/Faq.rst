General Questions
=================

.. _crowdin-faq-pootle:

Will the old translation server be disabled?
--------------------------------------------

The old translation server under :samp:`https://translation.typo3.org/` has been
turned off in July 2023.

The existing and exported translations which are downloaded within the Install Tool will be available for longer time.


.. _crowdin-faq-extension-missing:

My favorite extension is not available on Crowdin
-------------------------------------------------
If you miss an extension on Crowdin, contact the extension owner to create a project on Crowdin.
It is important that they follow the description on the page :ref:`Extension integration <crowdin-extension-integration>`.
The setup is a simple process and done within minutes.

.. _crowdin-faq-extension-language-missing:

My favorite language is not available for an extension
------------------------------------------------------
If you are missing the support for a specific language in an extension on Crowdin please contact either the maintainer
of the extension or the :ref:`crowdin-initiative`.

.. seealso::

   The language needs to be supported by TYPO3 itself as well, see :ref:`i18n_languages` for a list of all languages.

.. _crowdin-faq-language-xlf-format:

How to convert to the new language xlf file format
--------------------------------------------------
If you have :ref:`downloaded an xlf file <migrate-from-pootle>` from the
deactivated Pootle language server or an old version of an extension,
then it does not have the correct format. You need to remove some attributes.
And you need to add the "resname" attribute.
For this you can use a linux tool or a sophisticated editor to copy the `id` attribute into the `resname` of
the xlf file based on regular expressions.

In most editors you can use regular expressions. For example in the KDE Kate editor:

#. Open the xlf file into the editor.
#. Press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`R` to get into the replace mode
#. Find:    `id="(.+)"`
   Replace: `id="\1" resname="\1"`
#. Mode:     Regular expression
#. Click on button `Replace all`


Questions about extension integration
=====================================

.. _crowdin-faq-duplicated-labels:

Why does Crowdin show me translations in source language?
---------------------------------------------------------
If you just have setup Crowdin and you ship translated xlf files within your extension, those will be shown as well as to be translated.

You need to exlude those in your `.crowdin.yaml` configuration which can be found in the extension root directory.

.. code-block:: yaml

    files:
      - source: /Resources/Private/Language/
        translation: /%original_path%/%two_letters_code%.%original_file_name%
        ignore:
          - /Resources/Private/Language/de.*

.. attention::

   In the long run, you should remove the translations from your extension as those will be provided by the translation server.

More information can be found in the documentation on crowdin: https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/


..  index:: Crowdin; Migration from Pootle
..  _migrate-from-pootle:

How can I migrate translations from Pootle?
-------------------------------------------
If translations existed on Pootle, there is no need to retranslate everything on Crowdin again - you can import those.


#. **Fetch translations**
   Download the translations you need. You will need to download them directly from the TER with the following URL pattern:

   :samp:`https://extensions.typo3.org/fileadmin/ter/<e>/<x>/<extension_key>-l10n/<extension_key>-l10n-<lang>.zip`

   Here `<extension_key>` is the full extension key, `<e>` the 1st and `<x>` the 2nd letter of that extension key.
   Finally `<lang>` is the 2-lettered language identifier, e.g. `de`.

   For example to download the German translations of the extension *powermail*:
   `wget 'https://extensions.typo3.org/fileadmin/ter/p/o/powermail-l10n/powermail-l10n-de.zip'`

#. **Open and Cleanup**
   Unzip the translations and switch to e.g. `Resources/Private/Language` which is the typical directory
   of translations. Remove the *xml* files as only the *xlf* files are important.

#. **Match the Files**
   The attribute `original` of the translations must match the ones of the default translations.
   **Example**: The file :file:`Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf` starts with the following snippet:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
         <xliff version="1.0">
            <file source-language="en" datatype="plaintext" original="EXT:powermail/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf">

   The file :file:`de.locallang.xlf` must be modified and `original="messages"` must be changed to `original="EXT:powermail/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf"`

#. **Upload the Translations**
   Just keep on reading the next question.


.. index:: Crowdin; Upload xlf files

Can I upload translated xlf files?
----------------------------------
Yes, you can! Switch to the settings area of your project (you need to have the proper permissions for that) and you can upload xlf files or even zip files containg the xlf files.

.. figure:: /Images/ExternalImages/Crowdin/Upload.png
   :alt: Upload translations
   :width: 600px

   Upload translations

After triggering the upload Crowdin tries to find the matching source files and the target languages.
It might be that you need to adopt both if not found automatically.



Questions about TYPO3 CMS core integration
==========================================

The Core Team added a new system extension. Why are language packs not available even though it has already been translated into language XY?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new system extension needs to be added to the configuration of https://github.com/TYPO3/crowdin-bridge/. You can speed up the change by creating
a pull request like this one https://github.com/TYPO3/crowdin-bridge/pull/6/commits
