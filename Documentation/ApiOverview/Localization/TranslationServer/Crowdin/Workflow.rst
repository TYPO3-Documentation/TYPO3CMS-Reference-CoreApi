Workflow
========

The following workflow is used to bring a translation into a TYPO3 installation.

..  rst-class:: bignums

#.  English sources

    The sources in English are maintained in the project itself.

#.  Creating translations on Crowdin.com

    The translations for the TYPO3 Core are managed on Crowdin at
    https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-cms.

    You can either translate all strings on the Crowdin platform or directly in
    the TYPO3 backend.

    You can find the status of translations for TYPO3 Core and extensions here:
    https://localize.typo3.org/xliff/status.html

#.  Crowdin Bridge

    A separate project is accountable for exporting the translations from Crowdin.
    This consists of several steps:

    *   Trigger a build of all projects
    *   Download all translations including multiple branches and all available languages
    *   Create ZIP files of all single :ref:`XLIFF <xliff>` files
    *   Copy the files to the translation server

    The Crowdin Bridge is available under https://github.com/TYPO3/crowdin-bridge.

#.  Import translations into TYPO3 installations

    The translations can be downloaded within a TYPO3 installation.
    This is described under :ref:`xliff-translating-fetch`.
