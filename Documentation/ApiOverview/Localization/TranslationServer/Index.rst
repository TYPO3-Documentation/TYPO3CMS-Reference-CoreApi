Translation servers
===================

A translation server holds all translations which can be fetched by multiple
TYPO3 installations. The translations for the TYPO3 Core and several third-party
extensions are managed via Crowdin. But it is also possible to operate your own
translation server and connect it with a TYPO3 installation for custom
extensions.
