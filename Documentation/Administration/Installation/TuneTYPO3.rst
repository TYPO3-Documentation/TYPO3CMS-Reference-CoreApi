Tuning TYPO3
============

This chapter contains information on how to configure and optimize the infrastructure
running TYPO3.

OPcache
=======

It is recommended that OPcache be enabled on the web server running TYPO3. OPcache's
default settings will provide significant performance improvements; however there are
some changes you can make to help further improve stability and performance. In addition
enabling certain features in OPcache can lead to performance degradation.

Enabling OPcache
----------------

.. code-block:: ini
  :caption: php.ini

  opcache.enable=1
  opcache.revalidate_freq=30
  opcache.revalidate_path=0

Tuning OPcache
--------------

Below is list a of OPcache features with information on how they can impact TYPO3's performance.

.. confval:: opcache.save_comments

 :Default: 1
 :Recommended: 1

 Setting this to 0 may improve performance but some parts of TYPO3 (including Extbase)
 rely on information stored in phpDoc comments to function correctly.

.. confval:: opcache.use_cwd

 :Default: 1
 :Recommended: 1

 Setting the value to 0 may cause problems in certain applications because files
 that have the same name may get mixed up due to the complete path of the file not
 being stored as a key. TYPO3 works with absolute paths so this would
 return no improvements to performance.

.. confval:: opcache.validate_timestamps

 :Default: 1
 :Recommended: 1

 While setting this to 0 may speed up performance, you **must** make sure to
 flush opcache whenever changes are made to the PHP scripts or they will not
 be updated in OPcache. This can be achieved by using a proper deployment
 pipeline. Additionally, some files can be added to the blacklist, see `opcache.blacklist_filename` for more information.

.. confval:: opcache.revalidate_freq

 :Default: 2
 :Recommended: 30

 Setting this to a high value can improve performance but shares the same issue
 when setting `validate_timestamps` to 0.

.. confval:: opcache.revalidate_path

 :Default: 1
 :Recommended: 0

 Setting this value to 0 should be safe with TYPO3. This may be a problem if
 relative path names are used to load scripts and if the same file exists several
 times in the include path.

.. confval:: opcache.max_accelerated_files

 :Default: 10000
 :Recommended: 10000

 The default setting should be enough for TYPO3, but this depends
 on the number of additional scripts that need to be loaded by the system.
