During the initial installation, TYPO3's default :file:`.htaccess` file is copied to the installation root folder.

**Virtual Host Record**

*  `AllowOverride <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride>`__ needs to include "Indexes" and "FileInfo" in the Virtual Host record.

**Apache Modules**

The following Apache modules are required. The list is based on what is used in
the default TYPO3
`.htaccess <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess>`__.
In some cases, it is not a "hard" requirement, but is strongly recommended for
security or performance reasons, but you can also handle the desired outcome
in a different way with a different module.

mod_alias:

mod_authz_core:
