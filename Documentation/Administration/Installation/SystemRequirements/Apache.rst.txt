During the initial installation, TYPO3's default :file:`.htaccess` file is copied to the installation root folder.

..  _htaccess:

**.htaccess**

The :file:`.htaccess` file allows to configure Apache-specific TYPO3-related webserver settings.

The most important use of the file is to configure `RewriteRules`, security settings, PHP settings and MIME-type
handling.

TYPO3 ships a boilerplate configuration file (`.htaccess <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess>`__),
which is installed on first-time installation and then is assumed to be maintained depending on your project.

This means, on major TYPO3 updates, you need to ensure possible new TYPO3 adjustments are integrated in your
configuration. If you never update the file manually, copy over the contents of the new file from the
TYPO3 upgrade release. See :ref:`<maintain-htaccess>` for details on maintaining the file after a major
version upgrade.

The TYPO3 environment check (:guilabel:`Admin Tools > Environment > Check Directory Status`) will report whether a :file:`.htaccess` file differs from the default.


**Virtual Host Record**

*  `AllowOverride <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride>`__ needs to include "Indexes" and "FileInfo" in the Virtual Host record.

**Apache Modules**

The following Apache modules are required. The list is based on what is used in
the default TYPO3
`.htaccess <https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess>`__.
In some cases, it is not a "hard" requirement, but is strongly recommended for
security or performance reasons, but you can also handle the desired outcome
in a different way with a different module.

mod_alias:
   Block access to vcs directories

mod_authz_core:
   Block access to specific files and directories

mod_deflate:
   Used for compression and performance.

mod_expires:
   Adds HTTP headers for browser caching and performance.

mod_filter:
   Used with mod_deflate.

mod_headers:
   Used in combination with `mod_deflate`.

mod_rewrite:
   Enable human readable urls.

mod_setenvif:
   Also used with `mod_deflate`.
