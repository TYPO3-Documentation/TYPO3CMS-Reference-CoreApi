Required Database Privileges
----------------------------

The database user requires the following privileges on the TYPO3
database:

* SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

* CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES

It is recommended to also grant the following privileges:

* CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW

* EXECUTE, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE

Some database systems like MySQL and MariaDB allow to configure
SQL language support through a :sql`SQL_MODE` setting.

TYPO3 strives to be compatible to the DEFAULT `SQL_MODE` settings
of the database engine versions supported by a specific TYPO3 release.

If you change any setting to a NON-default SQL mode, be prepared to
audit all involved code to be compatible to your server mode choice.
Notably the settings `ANSI` and `ANSI_QUOTES` may cause issues.

`NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO`, `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`, `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER`,
`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`, `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`, `NO_ZERO_DATE`,
`NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`, `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` and `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` should
work with TYPO3 versions 12 and upwards, as the internal tests are
performed with the `SQL_MODE` set to those keys.

Custom or third-party extensions need to be evaluated individually.

Listed as being incompatible is: `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`.
