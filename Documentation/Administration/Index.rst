    ..  card:: Production environment

        This chapter contains information on how to configure and optimize the infrastructure
        running TYPO3 for production.

    ..  card:: :ref:`Running TYPO3 in Docker <admin-docker-index>`

        Learn how to run TYPO3 using Docker containers for local development and testing,
        including step-by-step guides for plain Docker, Docker Compose, and DDEV.

        :ref:`Docker-based TYPO3 setups <admin-docker-index>`

    ..  card:: Directory structure

        The folder layout of your TYPO3 project depends on how TYPO3 was installed.
        Composer-based installations use a modern structure that separates code from
        public filesâ€”ideal for deployment workflows and version control. Classic mode
        keeps everything in a single folder and is easier to set up for beginners.

        Both methods are fully supported for production use, however there are
        security consideration regarding
        `file access <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:security-restrict-access-server-level>`_
        when using the classic structure.

        *   `Directory structure, Composer <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:directory-structure>`_
