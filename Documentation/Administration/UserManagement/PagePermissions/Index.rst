    The module to handle page permissions has been renamed from
    :guilabel:`Access` to :guilabel:`Permissions`.

:ref:`DB mounts <db-mounts>` are not the whole story about access to pages.
Users and groups also need to have rights to perform operations on the
pages, like viewing, editing or deleting.

This is managed using the :guilabel:`System > Permissions` module:

    The "Permissions" module with ownerships and permissions

Every page has an owner, who is a user, and also group
membership. Rights can be assigned to the owner, to the group
or to everyone. This will be familiar to Unix users.

To change the permissions, click on the edit button.

It is also possible to change owner, group and permissions
recursively, even for the whole page tree. Use the dropdown to select the depth.

By choosing group "Editors" as group and then "Set recursively 2 levels"
in the "Depth" dropdown, we will assign **all** pages in the
page tree to the "Editors" group.
