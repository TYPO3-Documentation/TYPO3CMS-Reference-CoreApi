Upgrading extensions
====================

How you upgrade extensions depends on your role and project setup:

-   If you use third-party extensions, update them via Composer or the
    Extension Manager.
-   If you **maintain your own custom extension or site package**, refer to
    the dedicated guide on updating your codebase.
