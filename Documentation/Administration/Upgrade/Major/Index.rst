        Before upgrading TYPO3 to a major release, there are several tasks that can be performed
        to help ensure a successful upgrade and help minimise any potential downtime.

        This chapter details how to perform a major upgrade using Composer.

    ..  card:: :ref:`Post-upgrade tasks <PostUpgradeTasks>`
