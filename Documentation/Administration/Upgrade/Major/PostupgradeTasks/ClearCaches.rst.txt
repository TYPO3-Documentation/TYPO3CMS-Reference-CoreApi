Additionally, after an upgrade to a new major version, you should also delete
the other temporary files, which TYPO3 saves in the :file:`typo3temp/` folder.
In the :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Maintenance` module click on the
:guilabel:`Remove Temporary Assets > Scan temporary files` button and select the
appropriate folders.

..  note::
    When you delete the :file:`_processed_/` folder of a file storage all scaled
    images will be removed and the according images processed again when
    visiting a webpage the next time. This may slow down the first rendering of
    the webpage.
