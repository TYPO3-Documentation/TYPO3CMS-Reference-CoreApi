Enter the Install Tool at :samp:`https://example.org/typo3/install.php` on your
TYPO3 site.

TYPO3 provides an upgrade wizard for easy upgrading. Go to the :guilabel:`Upgrade`
section and choose :guilabel:`Upgrade Wizard`.
Take a look at the different wizards provided. You should go
through them one by one.

You must start with :guilabel:`Create missing tables and fields`
if it's displayed, which adds new tables and columns to the database.

Click :guilabel:`Execute`. Now all :file:`ext_tables.sql` files from core and extensions
are read and compared to your current database tables and columns. Any missing
tables and columns will be shown and you'll be able to execute queries
sufficient to add them.

After you added these tables and columns, go on to the next wizard.

..  hint::
    If you have CLI access you can run the update wizards on command line, too.
    This allows you to run all upgrade wizards at once and might help with
    long-running wizards that may fail because of webserver timeouts otherwise.

    For Composer mode

    Run :bash:`./vendor/bin/typo3 upgrade:list -a` to show a complete status of
    upgrade wizards.

    Use :bash:`./vendor/bin/typo3 upgrade:run <wizardName>` to run a specific wizard.

    Use :bash:`./vendor/bin/typo3 upgrade:run` to run all wizards.

    For legacy mode (non-Composer mode) replace :bash:`./vendor/bin/typo3` with
    `./typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3`.

The "Version Compatibility" wizard sets the compatibility version of your TYPO3
installation to the new version. This allows your frontend output to use new
features of the new TYPO3 version.

..  note::
    This wizard might affect how your website is rendered. After finishing
    the upgrade, check that your website still displays the way it is
    supposed to be and adjust your TypoScript if necessary.

Go through all wizards and apply the (database) updates they propose. Please
note that some wizards provide optional features, like installing system
extensions that you may not need in your current
installation, so take care to only apply those wizards, which you really need.
Apply the optional wizards too - just be sure to select the correct option
(e.g. "No, do not execute"). This way, these wizards will also be removed from
the list of wizards to execute and the upgrade will be marked as "done".

..  include:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Upgrade/UpgradeWizardExecute.rst.txt

After running through the upgrade wizards go to :guilabel:`Maintenance` >
:guilabel:`Analyze Database Structure`.
You will be able to execute queries to adapt them so that the tables and
columns used by the TYPO3 Core correspond to the structure required for the new
TYPO3 version.

..  note::
    If you don't know the current Install Tool password,
    you can set a new one by entering one in the Install Tool login screen,
    hitting enter and then setting the displayed hash as value
    of :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['installToolPassword']`
    in :file:`config/system/settings.php`.
