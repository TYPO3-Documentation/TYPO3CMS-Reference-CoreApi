Make a backup first! If things go wrong, you can at least go back to the old
version. You need a backup of

*   all files of your TYPO3 installation (by using FTP, SCP, rsync, or any other
    method)

*   the database (by exporting the database to an SQL file)

Also, you may prefer to upgrade a copy of your site first, if there have been a
lot of changes and some of them might interfere with functions of your site.
See the :doc:`changelog <ext_core:Index>` to check that.

For more detailed information about TYPO3 backups see :ref:`t3coreapi:security-backups`
in *TYPO3 Explained*.
