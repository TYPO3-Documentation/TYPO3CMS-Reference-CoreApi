..  todo: Remove this chapter for TYPO3 v13

..  versionchanged:: 12.0
    The support of global extensions was removed with TYPO3 v12.0. Convert them
    to local ones.

Global extensions used to be saved in folders inside
:file:`typo3/ext/`, such as :file:`typo3/ext/news`. In current
versions of TYPO3, this location should no longer be used. Instead,
use local extensions below :file:`typo3conf/ext/`.

To convert a global extension to a local one, do the following:

*   Go to the :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions` backend module.
*   Uninstall the global extension.
*   On a filesystem-level of the installation (for example, via SSH shell
    or S/FTP), delete the directory including files and subdirectories of the
    corresponding extension directory in :file:`typo3/ext/`.
*   Reinstall the extension from the TYPO3 Extension Repository, which will put
    it into :file:`typo3conf/ext/`.


..  note::
    In earlier versions of TYPO3 global extensions were an easy way of sharing
    extensions between multiple TYPO3 instances. Nowadays, the recommended way of
    installing and maintaining extensions is via Composer, where you may use
    different strategies to achieve the same goal. One example would be to use
    `"path repositories" <https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path>`__
    in your :file:`composer.json` file
