In addition to the deprecations you may want to read the information about important
changes, new features and breaking changes for the release you are updating to.

The changelog is divided into four sections "Breaking Changes", "Features", "Deprecation" and
"Important". Before upgrading you should at least take a look at the sections "Breaking Changes"
and "Important" - changes described in those areas might affect your website.

..  tip::
    Breaking changes should be of no concern to you if you already handled the
    deprecations before upgrading.

The detailed information contains a section called "Affected Installations" which contains hints
whether or not your website is affected by the change.

There are 3 different methods you can use to read the changelogs:

#.  Look through the :doc:`changelogs <ext_core:Index>`
    online. This has the advantage that code blocks will be formatted nicely with
    syntax highlighting.
#.  Read the changelogs in the backend: :guilabel:`Upgrade > View Upgrade Documentation`.
    This has the advantage that you can filter by tags and mark individual changelogs
    as done. This way, it is possible to use the list like a todo list.
#.  Read the changelog in the :ref:`Extension Scanner <t3coreapi:extension-scanner>`
    (as explained above).
