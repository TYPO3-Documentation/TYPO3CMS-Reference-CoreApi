..  _reference-index:

..  tip::
    As the reference index might take some time, especially on instances not
    running it regularly, an upgrade via
    :ref:`command line (CLI) <t3coreapi:symfony-console-commands>` is
    recommended to avoid a timeout.

With command line (recommended)
-------------------------------

To run the reference index update, execute in the root folder of your project:

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Composer-based installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            vendor/bin/typo3 referenceindex:update

    ..  group-tab:: Legacy installation

        ..  code-block:: bash

            typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 referenceindex:update


..  tip::
    Use :bash:`referenceindex:update 2> /dev/null` to suppress the progress
    output, for example, if the command is executed by a cronjob.

Without command line
--------------------

Still in your old TYPO3 version, go to the
:guilabel:`System > DB check` module and use the
:guilabel:`Manage Reference Index` function.

Click on :guilabel:`Update reference index` to update the reference index. In
case there is a timeout, and you do not have CLI access (see above) you might
have to run the update multiple times.

..  note::
    The :doc:`lowlevel system extension <ext_lowlevel:Index>` must be installed
    for the mentioned backend module.
