.. php:class:: CacheInstruction

   This class contains cache details and is created or updated in middlewares of the
   Frontend rendering chain and added as Request attribute "frontend.cache.instruction".

   Its main goal is to *disable* the Frontend cache mechanisms in various scenarios, for
   instance when the admin panel is used to simulate access times, or when security
   mechanisms like cHash evaluation do not match.

   .. php:method:: disableCache(string $reason)

      Instruct the core Frontend rendering to disable Frontend caching. Extensions with
      custom middlewares may set this.

      Note multiple cache layers are involved during Frontend rendering: For instance multiple
      TypoScript layers, the page cache and potentially others. Those caches are read from and
      written to within various middlewares. Depending on the position of a call to this method
      within the middleware stack, it can happen that some or all caches have already been
      read of written.

      Extensions that use this method should keep an eye on their middleware positions in the
      stack to estimate the performance impact of this call. It's of course best to not use
      the 'disable cache' mechanic at all, but to handle caching properly in extensions.

      :param string $reason: the reason
