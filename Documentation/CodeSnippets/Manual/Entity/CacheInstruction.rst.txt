..  php:class:: CacheInstruction

    This class contains cache details and is created or updated in middlewares of the
    Frontend rendering chain and added as Request attribute "frontend.cache.instruction".

    Its main goal is to *disable* the Frontend cache mechanisms in various scenarios, for
    instance when the admin panel is used to simulate access times, or when security
    mechanisms like cHash evaluation do not match.

    ..  php:method:: disableCache(string $reason)

        Instruct the core Frontend rendering to disable Frontend caching. Extensions with
        custom middlewares may set this.

        Note multiple cache layers are involved during Frontend rendering: For instance multiple
        TypoScript layers, the page cache and potentially others. Those caches are read from and
        written to within various middlewares. Depending on the position of a call to this method
        within the middleware stack, it can happen that some or all caches have already been
        read of written.

        Extensions that use this method should keep an eye on their middleware positions in the
        stack to estimate the performance impact of this call. It's of course best to not use
        the 'disable cache' mechanic at all, but to handle caching properly in extensions.

        :param $reason: the reason

    ..  php:method:: isCachingAllowed()
        :returns: `bool`
