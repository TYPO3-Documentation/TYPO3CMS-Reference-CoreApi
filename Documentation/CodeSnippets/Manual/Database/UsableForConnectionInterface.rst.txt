..  php:interface:: UsableForConnectionInterface

    Custom driver middleware can implement this interface to decide per connection and
    connection configuration if it should be used or not. For example, registering a
    global driver middleware which only takes affect on connections using a specific
    driver like `pdo_sqlite`.

    Usually this should be a rare case and mostly a driver middleware can be simply
    configured as a connection middleware directly, which leaves this more or less
    a special implementation detail for the TYPO3 core.

    ..  php:method:: canBeUsedForConnection(string $identifier, array $connectionParams)
        :returns: `bool`

        Return true if the driver middleware should be used for the concrete connection.

        :param $identifier: the identifier
        :param $connectionParams: the connectionParams
