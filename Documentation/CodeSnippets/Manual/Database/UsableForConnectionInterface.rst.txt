.. php:interface:: UsableForConnectionInterface

   Custom driver middleware can implement this interface to decide per connection and
   connection configuration if it should be used or not. For example, registering a
   global driver middleware which only takes affect on connections using a specific
   driver like `pdo_sqlite`.

   Usually this should be a rare case and mostly a driver middleware can be simply
   configured as a connection middleware directly, which leaves this more or less
   a special implementation detail for the TYPO3 core.

   .. php:method:: canBeUsedForConnection(string $identifier, array $connectionParams)

      Return true if the driver middleware should be used for the concrete connection.

      :param string $identifier: the identifier
      :param array $connectionParams: the connectionParams
      :returntype: bool
