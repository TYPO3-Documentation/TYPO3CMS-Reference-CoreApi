   Interface PreviewRendererInterface

   Contract for classes capable of rendering previews of a given record
   from a table. Responsible for rendering preview header, preview content
   and wrapping of those two values.

   Responsibilities are segmented into three methods, one for each responsibility,
   which is done in order to allow overriding classes to change those parts
   individually without having to replace other parts. Rather than relying on
   implementations to be friendly and divide code into smaller pieces and
   give them (at least) protected visibility, the key methods are instead required
   on the interface directly.

   Callers are then responsible for calling each method and combining/wrapping
   the output appropriately.

   .. php:method:: renderPageModulePreviewHeader(TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item)

      Dedicated method for rendering preview header HTML for
      the page module only. Receives the the GridColumnItem
      that contains the record for which a preview header
      should be rendered and returned.

      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item: the item
      :returntype: string

   .. php:method:: renderPageModulePreviewContent(TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item)

      Dedicated method for rendering preview body HTML for
      the page module only. Receives the the GridColumnItem
      that contains the record for which a preview should be
      rendered and returned.

      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item: the item
      :returntype: string

   .. php:method:: renderPageModulePreviewFooter(TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item)

      Render a footer for the record to display in page module below
      the body of the item's preview.

      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item: the item
      :returntype: string

   .. php:method:: wrapPageModulePreview(string $previewHeader, string $previewContent, TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item)

      Dedicated method for wrapping a preview header and body
      HTML. Receives $item, an instance of GridColumnItem holding
      among other things the record, which can be used to determine
      appropriate wrapping.

      :param string $previewHeader: the previewHeader
      :param string $previewContent: the previewContent
      :param TYPO3\\CMS\\Backend\\View\\BackendLayout\\Grid\\GridColumnItem $item: the item
      :returntype: string
