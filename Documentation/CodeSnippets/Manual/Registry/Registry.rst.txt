..  php:class:: Registry

    A class to store and retrieve entries in a registry database table.

    This is a simple, persistent key-value-pair store.

    The intention is to have a place where we can store things (mainly settings)
    that should live for more than one request, longer than a session, and that
    shouldn't expire like it would with a cache. You can actually think of it
    being like the Windows Registry in some ways.

    ..  php:method:: get(?string $namespace, ?string $key, ?mixed $defaultValue = NULL)
        :returns: `mixed`

        Returns a persistent entry.

        :param $namespace: Extension key of extension
        :param $key: Key of the entry to return.
        :param $defaultValue: Optional default value to use if this entry has never been set. Defaults to NULL., default: NULL
        :Return description: Value of the entry.

    ..  php:method:: set(?string $namespace, ?string $key, ?mixed $value)

        Sets a persistent entry.

        This is the main method that can be used to store a key-value-pair.

        Do not store binary data into the registry, it's not build to do that,
        instead use the proper way to store binary data: The filesystem.

        :param $namespace: Extension key of extension
        :param $key: The key of the entry to set.
        :param $value: The value to set. This can be any PHP data type; This class takes care of serialization

    ..  php:method:: remove(?string $namespace, ?string $key)

        Unset a persistent entry.

        :param $namespace: Extension key of extension
        :param $key: The key of the entry to unset.

    ..  php:method:: removeAllByNamespace(?string $namespace)

        Unset all persistent entries of given namespace.

        :param $namespace: Extension key of extension
