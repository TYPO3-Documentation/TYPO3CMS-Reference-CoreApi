.. php:namespace::  TYPO3\CMS\Core\Mail\Event

.. php:class:: AfterMailerSentMessageEvent

   This event is fired once a Mailer has sent a message and allows listeners to execute
   further code afterwards, depending on the result, e.g. the SentMessage.
   
   Note: Usually TYPO3\CMS\Core\Mail\Mailer is given to the event. This implementation
   allows to retrieve the SentMessage using the getSentMessage() method. Depending
   on the Transport, used to send the message, this might also be NULL.
