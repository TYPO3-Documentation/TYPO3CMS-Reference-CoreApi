..  php:class:: BeforeFileCreatedEvent

    This event is fired before a file is about to be created within a Resource Storage / Driver.

    The folder represents the "target folder".

    This allows to further analyze or modify the file or filename before it is written by the driver.

    ..  php:method:: getFileName()
        :returns: `string`

    ..  php:method:: getFolder()
        :returns: `\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Folder`
