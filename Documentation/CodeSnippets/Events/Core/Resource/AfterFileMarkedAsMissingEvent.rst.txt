..  php:class:: AfterFileMarkedAsMissingEvent

    This event is fired once a file was just marked as missing in the database (sys_file).

    Example: If a file is marked as missing, listeners can try to recover a file. This can happen on specific setups
    where editors also work via FTP.

    ..  php:method:: getFileUid()
        :returns: int
