.. php:class:: BeforeFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent

   Listeners to this event are able to specify a flex form data structure that
   corresponds to a given identifier.
   
   Listeners should call ->setDataStructure() to set the data structure (this
   can either be a resolved data structure string, a "FILE:" reference or a
   fully parsed data structure as array) or ignore the event to allow other
   listeners to set it. Do not set an empty array or string as this will
   immediately stop event propagation!
   
   See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.

   
   .. php:method:: getDataStructure()
   
      Returns the current data structure, which will always be `null`
      for listeners, since the event propagation is stopped as soon as
      a listener sets a data structure.
      
      :returntype: array|string|null
      
   .. php:method:: setDataStructure(array|string $dataStructure)
   
      Allows to either set an already parsed data structure as `array`,
      a file reference or the XML structure as `string`. Setting a data
      structure will immediately stop propagation. Avoid setting this parameter
      to an empty array or string as this will also stop propagation.
      
      :param array|string $dataStructure: the dataStructure
      
   .. php:method:: getIdentifier()
   
      :returntype: array
      
   .. php:method:: isPropagationStopped()
   
      :returntype: bool
