..  php:class:: BeforeFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent

    Listeners to this event are able to specify a flex form data structure that
    corresponds to a given identifier.

    Listeners should call ->setDataStructure() to set the data structure (this
    can either be a resolved data structure string, a "FILE:" reference or a
    fully parsed data structure as array) or ignore the event to allow other
    listeners to set it. Do not set an empty array or string as this will
    immediately stop event propagation!

    See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.

    ..  php:method:: getDataStructure()
        :returns: `array|string|?null`

        Returns the current data structure, which will always be `null`
        for listeners, since the event propagation is stopped as soon as
        a listener sets a data structure.

    ..  php:method:: setDataStructure(array|string $dataStructure)

        Allows to either set an already parsed data structure as `array`,
        a file reference or the XML structure as `string`. Setting a data
        structure will immediately stop propagation. Avoid setting this parameter
        to an empty array or string as this will also stop propagation.

        :param $dataStructure: the dataStructure

    ..  php:method:: getIdentifier()
        :returns: `array`

    ..  php:method:: isPropagationStopped()
        :returns: `bool`
