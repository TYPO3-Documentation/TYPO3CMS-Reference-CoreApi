.. php:class:: BeforeTcaOverridesEvent

   Event before $GLOBALS['TCA'] is overridden by TCA/Overrides to allow to manipulate $tca, before overrides are merged.

   Side note: It is possible to check against the original TCA as this is stored within $GLOBALS['TCA']
   before this event is fired.

      :returntype: array

   .. php:method:: setTca(array $tca)
