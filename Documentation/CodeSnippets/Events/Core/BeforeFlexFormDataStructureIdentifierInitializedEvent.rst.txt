..  php:class:: BeforeFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent

    Listeners to this event are able to specify the data structure identifier,
    used for a given TCA flex field.

    Listeners should call ->setIdentifier() to set the identifier or ignore the
    event to allow other listeners to set it. Do not set an empty string as this
    will immediately stop event propagation!

    The identifier SHOULD include the keys specified in the Identifier definition
    on FlexFormTools, and nothing else. Adding other keys may or may not work,
    depending on other code that is enabled, and they are not guaranteed nor
    covered by BC guarantees.

    Warning: If adding source record details like the uid or pid here, this may turn out to be fragile.
    Be sure to test scenarios like workspaces and data handler copy/move well, additionally, this may
    break in between different core versions.
    It is probably a good idea to return at least something like [ 'type' => 'myExtension', ... ], see
    the core internal 'tca' and 'record' return values below

    See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.

    ..  php:method:: getFieldTca()
        :returns: array

        Returns the full TCA of the currently handled field, having
        `type=flex` set.

    ..  php:method:: getTableName()
        :returns: string

    ..  php:method:: getFieldName()
        :returns: string

    ..  php:method:: getRow()
        :returns: array

        Returns the whole database row of the current record.

    ..  php:method:: setIdentifier(array $identifier)

        Allows to define the data structure identifier for the TCA field.

        Setting an identifier will immediately stop propagation. Avoid
        setting this parameter to an empty array as this will also stop
        propagation.

        :param array $identifier: the identifier

    ..  php:method:: getIdentifier()
        :returns: array

        Returns the current data structure identifier, which will always be
        `null` for listeners, since the event propagation is
        stopped as soon as a listener defines an identifier.

    ..  php:method:: isPropagationStopped()
        :returns: bool
