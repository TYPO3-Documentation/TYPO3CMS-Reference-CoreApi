.. php:class:: BeforeFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent

   Listeners to this event are able to specify the data structure identifier,
   used for a given TCA flex field.
   
   Listeners should call ->setIdentifier() to set the identifier or ignore the
   event to allow other listeners to set it. Do not set an empty string as this
   will immediately stop event propagation!
   
   The identifier SHOULD include the keys specified in the Identifier definition
   on FlexFormTools, and nothing else. Adding other keys may or may not work,
   depending on other code that is enabled, and they are not guaranteed nor
   covered by BC guarantees.
   
   Warning: If adding source record details like the uid or pid here, this may turn out to be fragile.
   Be sure to test scenarios like workspaces and data handler copy/move well, additionally, this may
   break in between different core versions.
   It is probably a good idea to return at least something like [ 'type' => 'myExtension', ... ], see
   the core internal 'tca' and 'record' return values below
   
   See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.

   
   .. php:method:: getFieldTca()
   
      Returns the full TCA of the currently handled field, having
      `type=flex` set.
      
      :returntype: array
      
   .. php:method:: getTableName()
   
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: getFieldName()
   
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: getRow()
   
      Returns the whole database row of the current record.
      
      :returntype: array
      
   .. php:method:: setIdentifier(array $identifier)
   
      Allows to define the data structure identifier for the TCA field.
      
      Setting an identifier will immediately stop propagation. Avoid
      setting this parameter to an empty array as this will also stop
      propagation.
      
      :param array $identifier: the identifier
      
   .. php:method:: getIdentifier()
   
      Returns the current data structure identifier, which will always be
      `null` for listeners, since the event propagation is
      stopped as soon as a listener defines an identifier.
      
      :returntype: array
      
   .. php:method:: isPropagationStopped()
   
      :returntype: bool
