.. php:class:: AfterFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent

   Listeners to this event are able to modify or enhance a flex form data
   structure that corresponds to a given identifier, after it was parsed and
   before it is used by further components.
   
   Note: Since this event is not stoppable, all registered listeners are
   called. Therefore, you might want to namespace your identifiers in a way,
   that there is little chance they overlap (e.g. prefix with extension name).
   
   See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.
