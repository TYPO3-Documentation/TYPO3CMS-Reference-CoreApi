.. php:class:: AfterFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent

   Listeners to this event are able to modify or enhance a flex form data
   structure that corresponds to a given identifier, after it was parsed and
   before it is used by further components.

   Note: Since this event is not stoppable, all registered listeners are
   called. Therefore, you might want to namespace your identifiers in a way,
   that there is little chance they overlap (e.g. prefix with extension name).

   See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.

   .. php:method:: getIdentifier()

      :returntype: array

   .. php:method:: getDataStructure()

      Returns the current data structure, which has been processed and
      parsed by the `FlexFormTools` component. Might contain additional
      data from previously called listeners.

      :returntype: array

   .. php:method:: setDataStructure(array $dataStructure)

      Allows to modify or completely replace the parsed data
      structure identifier.

      :param array $dataStructure: the dataStructure
