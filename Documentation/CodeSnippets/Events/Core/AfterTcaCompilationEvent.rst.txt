.. php:class:: AfterTcaCompilationEvent

   Event after $GLOBALS['TCA'] is built to allow to further manipulate $tca.
   
   Side note: It is possible to check against the original TCA as this is stored within $GLOBALS['TCA']
   before this event is fired.

      :returntype: array
      
   .. php:method:: setTca(array tca)
   
      :param array $tca: the tca
