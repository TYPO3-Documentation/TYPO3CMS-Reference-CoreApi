.. php:class:: AfterFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent

   Listeners to this event are able to modify or enhance the data structure identifier,
   which is used for a given TCA flex field.

   This event can be used to add additional data to an identifier. Be careful here, especially if
   stuff from the source record like uid or pid is added! This may easily lead to issues with
   data handler details like copy or move records, localization and version overlays.
   Test this very well! Multiple listeners may add information to the same identifier here -
   take care to namespace array keys. Information added here can be later used in the
   data structure related PSR-14 Events (BeforeFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent and
   AfterFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent) again.

   See the note on FlexFormTools regarding the schema of $dataStructure.
