.. php:class:: AfterTypoScriptDeterminedEvent

   This event is dispatched after the FrontendTypoScript object has been calculated,
   just before it is attached to the request.

   The event is designed to enable listeners to act on specific TypoScript conditions.
   Listeners *must not* modify TypoScript at this point, the core will try to actively
   prevent this.

   This event is especially useful when "upper" middlewares that do not have the
   determined TypoScript need to behave differently depending on TypoScript 'config' that
   is only created after them.
   The core uses this in the TimeTrackInitialization and the WorkspacePreview middlewares,
   to determine debugging and preview details.

   Note both 'settings' ("constants") and 'config' are *always* set within the
   FrontendTypoScript at this point, even in 'fully cached page' scenarios. 'setup'
   and (@internal) 'page' may not be set.
