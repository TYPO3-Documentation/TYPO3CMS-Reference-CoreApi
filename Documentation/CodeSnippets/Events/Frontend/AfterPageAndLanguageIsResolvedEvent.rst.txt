   A PSR-14 event fired in the frontend process after a given page has been resolved including
   its language.
   
   This event is intended to e.g. modify TYPO3's language resolving logic by custom additions.
   This event also allows to send a custom Response via Event Listeners (e.g. a custom 403 response)
