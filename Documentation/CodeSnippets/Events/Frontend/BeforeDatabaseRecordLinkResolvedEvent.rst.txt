..  php:class:: BeforeDatabaseRecordLinkResolvedEvent

    A PSR-14 event fired in the frontend process before database record
    lookup is done for a link.

    This event makes it possible to implement custom logic, for example,
    for specific frontend access when retrieving a linked record in a typolink.

    ..  php:attr:: linkDetails
        :readonly:
        :public:

    ..  php:attr:: databaseTable
