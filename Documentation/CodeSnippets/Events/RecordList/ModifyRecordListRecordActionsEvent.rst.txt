.. php:class:: ModifyRecordListRecordActionsEvent

   An event to modify the displayed record actions (e.g.
   
   "edit", "copy", "delete") for a table in the RecordList.

   
   .. php:method:: setAction()
   
      Add a new action or override an existing one. Latter is only possible,
      in case $columnName is given. Otherwise, the column will be added with
      a numeric index, which is generally not recommended. It's also possible
      to define the position of an action with either the "before" or "after"
      argument, while their value must be an existing action.
      
      Note: In case non or an invalid $group is provided, the new action will
      be added to the secondary group.
      
      
   .. php:method:: hasAction()
   
      Whether the action exists in the given group. In case non or
      an invalid $group is provided, both groups will be checked.
      
      :returntype: bool
      
   .. php:method:: getAction()
   
      Get action by its name. In case the action exists in both groups
      and non or an invalid $group is provided, the action from the
      "primary" group will be returned.
      
      :returntype: string
      
   .. php:method:: removeAction()
   
      Remove action by its name. In case the action exists in both groups
      and non or an invalid $group is provided, the action will be removed
      from both groups.
      
      :returntype: bool
      :returns: Whether the action could be removed - Will therefore return FALSE if the action to remove does not exist.
