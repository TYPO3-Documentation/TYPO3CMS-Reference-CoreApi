..  php:class:: BeforeLabelResourceResolvedEvent

    Event that is fired after a file name has been mapped to a translation domain for all files
    of a package.

    E.g. "vendor/myext.messages" is mapped to "EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf"

    If you want this file to be a different location, e.g. for historical reasons, you can do this here.

    ..  php:attr:: packageKey
        :readonly:
        :public:

    ..  php:attr:: domains
        :public:
