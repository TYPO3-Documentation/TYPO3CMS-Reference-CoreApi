    An HTTP middleware component participates in processing an HTTP message:
    by acting on the request, generating the response, or forwarding the
    request to a subsequent middleware and possibly acting on its response.

    ..  php:method:: process(\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request, \Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface $handler)
        :returns: `\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`

        Process an incoming server request.

        Processes an incoming server request in order to produce a response.
        If unable to produce the response itself, it may delegate to the provided

        :param $handler: the handler
