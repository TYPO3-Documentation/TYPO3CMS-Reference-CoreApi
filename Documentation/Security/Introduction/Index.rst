============
Introduction
============

Security is taken very seriously by the Core developers of TYPO3 projects
and especially by the members of the official TYPO3 Security Team. It is
also in the interest of system administrators, website owners, editors
and everybody who is responsible for a TYPO3 site, to protect the site
and its content against various threats. This chapter describes some
typical risks and advises on how to protect a TYPO3 site in order to
ensure it is and stays secure and stable.

This guide also explains how the TYPO3 Security Team deals with
incidents, how security bulletins and security updates are published
and how system administrators should react when their system has been
compromised.

It is important to understand that security is not a condition â€“
security is a process with ongoing tasks and regular reviews are
essential.

Reporting a security issue
==========================

If you would like to report a security issue in a TYPO3 extension or
the TYPO3 Core  system, please report it to the TYPO3 Security Team.
Please refrain from making anything public before an official fix is
released. Read more about the process of incident handling by the
TYPO3 Security Team in the :ref:`next chapter <security-team>`.


Target audience
===============

This chapter is intended for all users of TYPO3, from editors to
system administrators, from TYPO3 integrators to software developers.
The Security Guide is an essential lecture for everyone who
works with TYPO3 and who is responsible for a publicly accessible
TYPO3 site in particular.
