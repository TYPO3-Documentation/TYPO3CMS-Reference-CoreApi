=======================
TYPO3 security overview
=======================

TYPO3 takes security seriously—both in its Core development and through
the work of the official TYPO3 Security Team. But security is not just a
feature of the system. It is a shared responsibility that involves system
administrators, integrators, editors, and developers.

This chapter outlines common risks and how to mitigate them. It also
explains how the TYPO3 Security Team handles incidents and how to respond
if your site is compromised.

Security is not a fixed state—it is an ongoing process. Protecting your
site requires regular review, timely updates, and responsible access
control.

Reporting a security issue
==========================

If you would like to report a security issue in a TYPO3 extension or
the TYPO3 Core  system, please report it to the TYPO3 Security Team.
Please refrain from making anything public before an official fix is
released. Read more about the process of incident handling by the
:ref:`TYPO3 Security Team`.
