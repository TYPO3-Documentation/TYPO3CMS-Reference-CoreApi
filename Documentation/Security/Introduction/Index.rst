============
Introduction
============

Security is taken very seriously by the `Core`:pn: developers of `TYPO3`:pn: projects
and especially by the members of the official `TYPO3 Security Team`:pn:. It is
also in the interest of system administrators, website owners, editors
and everybody who is responsible for a `TYPO3`:pn: site, to protect the site
and its content against various threats. This chapter describes some
typical risks and advises on how to protect a `TYPO3`:pn: site in order to
ensure it is and stays secure and stable.

This guide also explains how the `TYPO3 Security Team`:pn: deals with
incidents, how security bulletins and security updates are published
and how system administrators should react when their system has been
compromised.

It is important to understand that security is not a condition –
security is a process with ongoing tasks and regular reviews are
essential.
