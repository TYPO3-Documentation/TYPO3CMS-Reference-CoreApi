========================================
Detect, analyze and repair a hacked site
========================================

Most websites do not get hacked. If yours did, there is something wrong
with it, or with the server, or with the hosting environment, or with
the security on your desktop computer, your editors' computers, etc.
You have to figure out how this happened so you can prevent it from
happening again. It is not enough to simply restore a hacked site â€“ it
will most likely be hacked again, sooner or later.

In case your server or TYPO3 website has been hacked, a number of
steps should be taken to restore the system and to prevent further
attacks. Some recommended actions are described in this chapter but
always keep in mind: if you are already in the situation that you have
to restore a hacked site, focus on the limitation of damage and do not
react over-hastily.
