Content security policy

    Content Security Policy declarations can be applied to a TYPO3 website in
    frontend and backend scope with a dedicated API.
    See :ref:`content-security-policy`.

Content security policy (CSP_) is an added layer of security that helps
to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including cross-site
scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for
everything from data theft to site defacement to the distribution of malware.

According to TYPO3-PSA-2019-010_ authenticated users - but not having
administrator privileges - are allowed to upload files to their granted
file mounts (e.g. `fileadmin/` in most cases). This also includes the
possibility to upload potential malicious code in HTML or SVG files
(using JavaScript, injecting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities).

To mitigate these potential scenarios it is advised to either
deny uploading files as described in TYPO3-PSA-2019-010_ (which might be
impractical for some sites) or add content security policy headers for
these directories - basically all public available base directories of
file storages (`sys_file_storage`).

The following example sends a corresponding CSP_ header for any file
accessed via :samp:`https://example.org/fileadmin/...`:

..  code-block:: apacheconf

    # placed in fileadmin/.htaccess on Apache 2.x webserver
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; style-src 'none'; object-src 'none';"
    </IfModule>

For nginx webservers, the following configuration example can be used to send
a CSP_ header for any file accessed via :samp:`https://example.org/fileadmin/...`:

..   code-block:: nginx

    map $request_uri $csp_header {
        ~^/fileadmin/ "default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; style-src 'none'; object-src 'none';";
    }

    server {
        # Add strict CSP header depending on mapping (fileadmin only)
        add_header Content-Security-Policy $csp_header;
        # ... other add_header declarations can follow here
    }

The nginx example configuration uses a map, since top level `add_header`
declarations will be overwritten if `add_header` is used in sublevels
(e.g. `location`) declarations.
