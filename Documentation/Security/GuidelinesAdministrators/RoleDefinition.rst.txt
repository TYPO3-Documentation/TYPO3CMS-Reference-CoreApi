Role Definition
===============

In this chapter, we define a system administrator as the person who
is responsible for the system/server where the TYPO3 instance is
installed. System administrators usually have full access on a server
level (operating system) and install, configure and maintain the base
system and hosting environment, including the database server, web
server, PHP, TYPO3, as well as components such as ImageMagick, etc.

System administrators are also responsible for the security of the
infrastructure in general, e.g. the network, the appropriate access to
the system (e.g. SSH, FTP, etc.) as well as correct permissions on a
file system level.

The role of a system administrator often overlaps with a TYPO3
integrator and it happens that one person has both roles.
