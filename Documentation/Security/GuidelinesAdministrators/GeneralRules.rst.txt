General Rules
=============

#. Subscribe to the "TYPO3 Announce" mailing list at
   `http://lists.typo3.org <http://lists.typo3.org/>`_ , so that you are
   informed about TYPO3 security bulletins and TYPO3 updates.

#. React as soon as possible and update the relevant components of the
   site(s) when new vulnerabilities become public (e.g. security issues
   published in the mailing list).

#. Use different passwords for the Install Tool and the backend login.
   Follow the guidelines for secure passwords in this document.

#. If you are administrating several TYPO3 installations, use different
   passwords for all logins and components for every installation.

#. Never use the same password for a TYPO3 installation and any other
   service such as `FTP`, `SSH`, etc.

#. Change the username and password of the "admin" account after the
   installation of TYPO3 immediately.

#. If you are also responsible for the setup and configuration of TYPO3,
   follow the steps for TYPO3 integrators carefully, documented in the
   next chapter.
