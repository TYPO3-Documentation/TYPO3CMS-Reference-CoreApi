Role definition: What is a system administrator?
================================================

In this chapter, a **system administrator** is the person responsible for the
server hosting the TYPO3 instance. This includes full Operation System level
access and managing the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the
system, including the database, web server, PHP, TYPO3, and tools like
ImageMagick.

They also ensure infrastructure security, including network access, secure
protocols (e.g., SSH, FTP), and correct file permissions.

This role often overlaps with that of a TYPO3 integrator and may be held by the
same person.
