Role definition: What is a system administrator?
================================================

In this chapter, a **system administrator** is a person responsible for a
server hosting a TYPO3 instance. This includes having full Operation System level
access and managing installation, configuration, and maintenance, including the
database, web server, PHP, TYPO3, and tools like ImageMagick.

They are also responsible for infrastructure security, which includes network access,
secure protocols (e.g., SSH, FTP), and correct file permissions.

This role often overlaps with that of a TYPO3 integrator and may be held by the
same person.
