General rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All :ref:`general rules <security-administrator-rules>` for a system administrator
also apply for a TYPO3 integrator. One of the most important rules is to change the
username and password of the "admin" account immediately after a TYPO3 system
was handed over from a system administrator to an integrator, if not
already done. The same applies to the Install Tool password, see
below.

In addition, the following general rules apply for a TYPO3 integrator:

#. Ensure backend users only have the permissions they need to do their
   work, nothing more â€“ and especially no administrator privileges, see
   explanations below.

#. Ensure, the TYPO3 sites they are responsible for, always run a stable
   and secure TYPO3 core version and always and only contain secure extensions
   (integrators update them immediately if a vulnerability has been
   discovered).

#. Stay informed about TYPO3 core updates. Integrators should know the
   changes when new TYPO3 major versions are released and should be aware
   of the impacts and risks of an update.

#. Integrators check for extension updates regularly and/or they know how
   to configure a TYPO3 system to notify them about new extension
   versions.
