TYPO3 versions and lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is offered in Long Term Support (LTS) and Sprint Release versions.

The first versions of each branch are Sprint Release versions. A Sprint Release
version only receives support until the next Sprint Release got published. E.g.
TYPO3 `9.0.0` was the first Sprint Release of the `9` branch and its support
ended when TYPO3 `9.1.0` got released.

An LTS version is planned to be created every 18 months. LTS versions are created
from a branch in order to finalize it: Prior to reaching LTS status, a number of
Sprint Releases has been created from that branch and the release of an LTS version
marks the point after which no new features will be added to this branch. LTS
versions get full support (bug fixes and security fixes) for at least three years.
TYPO3 version 8 (`v8`) and v9 are such LTS versions.

Starting with TYPO3 v7 the minor-versions are skipped in the official
naming. 7 LTS is version` 7.6` internally, 8 LTS is `8.7` and 9 LTS is `9.5`. Versions inside a
major-version have minor-versions as usual (`9.0`, `9.1`, ...) until at some
point the branch receives LTS-status.

Support and security fixes are provided for the current as well as the
preceding LTS release. For example, when TYPO3 v9 is the current LTS release,
TYPO3 v8 is still actively supported, including security updates.

For users of v8 an update to v9 is recommended. All versions below TYPO3 v8 are
outdated and the regular support of these versions has ended, including security updates.
Users of these versions are strongly encouraged to update their systems
as soon as possible.

In cases where users can't yet upgrade to a supported version, the TYPO3 GmbH is offering
an Extended Long Term Support (ELTS) service for up to three years after the regular support has ended.
Subscribers to the ELTS plans receive security and compatibility updates.

LTS and Sprint Releases offer new features and often a modified
database structure. Also the visual appearance and handling of the
backend may be changed and appropriate training for editors may be
required. The content rendering may change, so that updates in
`TypoScript`, templates or `CSS` code may be necessary. With LTS and
Sprint Releases also the system requirements (for example PHP or MySQL
version) may change. For a patch level releases (i.e.
changing from release `9.5.0` to `9.5.1`) the database structure and
backend will usually not change and an update will only require the
new version of the source code.

List of TYPO3 LTS releases:
