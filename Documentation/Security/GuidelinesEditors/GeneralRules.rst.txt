General rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`General Guidelines <security-general-guidelines>` also apply to editors
â€“ especially the section "Secure passwords" and "Operating system and browser version".

Due to the fact that editors do not change the configuration of the
system, there are only a few things editors should be aware of. As a
general rule, you should contact the person, team or agency who/which
is responsible for the system (usually the provider of the TYPO3
instance, a TYPO3 integrator or system administrator) if you determine
a system setup that does not match with the guidelines described here.
