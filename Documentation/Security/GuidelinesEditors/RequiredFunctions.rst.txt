Restriction to required functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some people believe that having more access privileges in a system is
better than having essential privileges only. This is not true from a
security perspective due to several reasons. Every additional
privilege introduces not only new risks to the system but also requires
more responsibility as well as security awareness from the user.

In most cases editors should prefer having access to functions and
parts of the website they really need to have and therefore you, as an
editor, should insist on correct and restricted access permissions.

Similar to the explanations above: too extensive and unnecessary
privileges are an indication of a badly configured system and
sometimes a lack of professionalism of the system administrator,
hosting provider or TYPO3 integrator.
