Secure connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should always use the secure, encrypted connection between your computer
and the TYPO3 backend. This is done by using the prefix `https://` instead of
`http://` at the beginning of the website address (URL). Nowadays, both the TYPO3
backend and frontend should be always - and exclusively - accessible via
`https://` only and invalid certificates are no longer acceptable. Please clarify
with the system administrator if no encrypted connection is available.

Under specific circumstances, a secure connection is technically
possible but an invalid SSL certificate causes a warning message. In
this case you may want to check the details of the certificate and let
the hosting provider fix this.
