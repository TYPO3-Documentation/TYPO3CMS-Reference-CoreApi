Authentication bypass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an authorization bypass attack, an attacker exploits
vulnerabilities in poorly designed applications or login forms (e.g.
client-side data input validation). Authentication modules shipped
with the TYPO3 core are well-tested and reviewed. However, due to the
open architecture of TYPO3, this system can be extended by alternative
solutions. The code quality and security aspects may vary, see chapter
:ref:`Guidelines for TYPO3 Integrators: TYPO3 extensions
<security-extensions>` for further details.
