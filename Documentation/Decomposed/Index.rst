================
TYPO3 Decomposed
================

Often, there are several ways to do things in TYPO3. While the feature
richness and configurability is one of the outstanding strengths of TYPO3,
it can perhaps be overwhelming for newcomers.

This chapter aims to give you an overview and brief summary by breaking
down some of the concepts and methods in TYPO3 by category. This way,
it is the glue for various bits and pieces and will hopefully give
you a better understanding of TYPO3.

The primary target audience are developers and integrators, but you
might also find some parts interesting as editor or admin.
