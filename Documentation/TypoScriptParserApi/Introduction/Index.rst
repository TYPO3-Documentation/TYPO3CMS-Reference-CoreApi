Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to deploy TypoScript in your own TYPO3 CMS applications it is
really easy. The TypoScript parser is readily available to you and the
only thing that may take a little more effort than the instantiation
of PHP is if you want to define conditions for TypoScript.

Basically this chapter will teach you how you can parse your own
TypoScript strings into a PHP array structure. The exercise might even
help you to further understand the straight forward nature of
TypoScript.

.. note::

   The following pages are for experienced TYPO3 CMS developers
   and require a good knowledge of PHP.
